INTRODUCTION  ★  ★

“FOOD  WILL  WIN  THE  WAR  AND  WRITE 

THE  PEACE” 


THIS  booklet  has  been  prepared  to 
meet  the  need  for  up-to-date  information, 
wanted  by  both  experienced  and  inex¬ 
perienced  gardeners  who  will  respond  to 
the  appeal  of  federal  and  state  agencies 
for  more  than  six  million  VICTORY 
GARDENS. 

Victory  Gardens  must  not  only  raise 
food  to  help  win  the  war,  but  Victory 
Gardeners  must  develop  a  garden  strategy 
which  provides  aggressive  action  for  pro¬ 
duction  of  more  vegetables  and  for  de¬ 
fense  against  their  enemies — insects  and 
disease. 

While  we  are  fighting  a  war  to  main¬ 
tain  our  freedoms,  we  must  see  to  it  that 
our  plants  are  secure  with  their  essential 
freedom  for  life  and  growth.  Freedom 
from  thirst,  from  starvation  and  from 
disease — these  are  the  three  freedoms 
we  must  guarantee,  along  with  security  in 
their  homes  in  the  soil.  Provide  these 
freedoms  and  you  have  the  answer  to  the 
question  of  How  to  Grow  a  Victory 
Garden. 


Secretary  of  Agriculture,  Claude  R. 
Wickard,  has  suggested  the  slogan  "Grow 
Vegetables  for  Vitality  for  Victory,’’  and 
everywhere  we  hear  the  suggestion  that 
another  "V"  be  added  so  that  the  slogan 
would  read  "Grow  V egetahles  for  Vita¬ 
mins  for  Vitality  for  Victory  .”  Home¬ 
grown  vegetables  will  not  only  furnish  us 
with  a  goodly  share  of  needed  vitamins, 
but  will  supply  needed  minerals  along 
with  the  basic  food  elements.  These  es¬ 
sential  proteins,  fats,  and  carbohydrates 


are  just  as  vital  as  vitamins,  and  food  ex¬ 
perts  agree  that  in  the  use  of  more  vege¬ 
tables  we  have  the  answer  to  better  nu¬ 
trition  and  health.  Let  us  grow,  choose 
and  use  our  vegetables  along  with  other 
foods  as  sources  of  minerals  and  diges¬ 
tible  nutrients,  but  at  the  same  time  seek 
the  added  blessings  of  their  Vitamins  for 
Greater  Vitality  for  Victory.  Victorious 
indeed  is  the  individual  who  avoids  ex¬ 
cesses  in  eating,  but  who  daily  gets  the 
right  amount  of  a  well-balanced  digest¬ 
ible  ration  of  water,  proteins,  starches, 
sugars,  fats,  and  minerals — plus  vita¬ 
mins. 

A  Victory  Garden  in  which  we  will 
grow  our  own  vegetables  as  a  contribu¬ 
tion  to  the  "all-out  effort  to  win  the 
war’’  will  automatically  provide  us  with 
more  nutrients  and  vitamins  than  our  fam¬ 
ily  would  obtain  from  "store  vegetables.’’ 

Finally,  we  now  have  this  golden  op¬ 
portunity  of  sharing  in  a  nation-wide  food 
conservation  program,  designed  especially 
to  save  on  costs  of  transporting  food,  re¬ 
duce  the  cost  of  living,  and  add  to  the 
supply  needed  to  replace  foods  shipped 
abroad.  Your  earnings  and  savings  from 
your  garden,  if  invested  in  defense  stamps 
or  bonds,  will  help  "win  the  war  and . 
write  the  peace.’’

WHERE  TO  CROW  VEGETABLES 


The  Garden  Site .  You  may  have  no 
choice.  There  may  be  just  one  spot  avail¬ 
able  to  you  for  use  as  a  garden.  It  may  be 
good,  bad,  or  indifferent.  If  the  condi¬ 
tions  essential  for  a  profitable  garden  are 
really  bad,  the  best  thing  to  do  is  to 
forget  gardening  until  you  can  arrange  to 
buy  or  rent  some  ground  where  vegetables 
will  thrive.  The  bad  conditions  which 
make  gardening  unprofitable  are  those 
associated  with  unworkable  soils,  absence 
of  sunlight,  inadequate  moisture,  and  poor 
drainage.  Although  very  bad  soils  can 
be  greatly  improved  by  providing  neces¬ 
sary  drainage,  improvement  of  their  physi¬ 
cal  condition,  and  renewal  of  their  fer¬ 
tility,  it  is  folly,  with  very  few  exceptions, 
to  try  to  grow  crops  in  the  shade. 

If  your  conditions  are  really  bad  as  re¬ 
gards  these  three  essentials,  it  would  be 
much  better  to  seek  another  site  for  your 
garden.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  plot  of 
ground  available  will  provide  sunlight  for 
an  average  of  at  least  six  hours  a  day, 
and  your  soil  is  not  too  heavy  and  sticky, 


or  water  does  not  stand  long  after  heavy 
rains,  your  chances  for  moderate  success 
are  excellent.  Under  these  conditions  you 
will  have  an  incentive  to  improve  the 
texture  and  fertility  of  your  soil,  remove 
trees  to  provide  more  sunlight,  and  sup¬ 
plement  the  natural  water  supply  as 
needed. 

Ideal  Garden  Soils.  In  choosing  a 
site,  select  as  level  a  piece  of  ground  as 
possible,  fully  exposed  to  the  sun  and 
preferably  longer  from  north  to  south  than 
east  to  west.  In  general,  a  southern  ex¬ 
posure  is  better  and  favors  earlier  crops. 
The  land  should  be  free  of  tree  and  vine 
roots.  Protection  by  buildings  or  other 
windbreaks,  especially  from  the  north, 
will  also  favor  earlier  maturity  of  crops. 
A  spadeful  of  soil,  turned  over  two  or 
three  days  after  a  rain,  should  fall  apart, 
or  a  fistful  clenched  in  the  hand  should 
crumble  when  released.  Such  a  soil  is  said 
to  be  friable.  On  the  average,  sandy 
loams  respond  more  readily  to  kind  treat-

An  excellent  beginning  for  a  small,  well  planned  garden 


A  Mighty  Good  Sign 

A  good  supply  of  decaying  organic 
matter  or  humus  is  a  mighty  good  sign  in 
both  sand  and  clay  loams.  It  is  for  this 
reason  that  manure  and  plant  residues  are 
returned  to  the  soil.  The  better  garden 
soils  are  also  fairly  deep  and  should  prove 
to  be  "pay  dirt”  if  the  topsoil  to  at 
least  the  depth  of  a  spade  is  permeated 
with  humus  and  decaying  vegetable  tis¬ 
sues,  but  not  sharply  separated  from  the 
subsoil  by  an  impervious  layer  of  clay  or 
hardpan.  The  really  good  garden  soil 
must  also  be  relatively  "sweet,”  and  by 
this  is  meant  it  should  be  almost  neutral 
or  only  slightly  acid  in  order  to  favor  the 
best  development  of  most  vegetables.  Soils 
that  are  acid  are  often  indicated  by  growth 
of  sorrel,  moss,  oxalis,  or  other  acid- 
loving  plants.  Such  soils  should  be  limed 
to  correct  this  acidity.  The  improvement 
of  garden  soils  is  discussed  in  our  section 
on  "Manure,  Fertilizer,  and  Lime.” 


ment  than  heavier  soils.  Although  even 
very  heavy  clays  or  clay  loams  can  be 
made  productive  and  satisfactory,  two  or 
three  years  may  be  needed  to  change  their 
texture  or  "make  them  over”  into  looser, 
more  friable  soils,  where  beneficial  soil 
bacteria  as  well  as  the  roots  of  vegetables 
can  flourish.

6  *  *  *  HOW  TO  GROW  A  VICTORY  GARDEN 


THE  CARDEN  PLAN 


Types  of  Gardens.  Although  a  dozen 
or  more  different  types  of  home  gardens 
might  be  described  or  classified  as  to 
size,  we  may  assume  that  there  are  only 
about  four  essentially  different  kinds  of 
home  gardens. 

First ,  there  is  the  farm  garden,  which 
may  supplement  other  crops  grown  on 
the  farm,  but  for  the  most  part  undertakes 
to  provide  the  abundance  of  vegetables 
and  small  fruits  needed  for  the  family 
and  farm  hands,  with  a  liberal  supply  for 
home-canned  foods.  Such  a  garden  might 
range  from  one-half  to  even  five  acres  in 
size. 


Second ,  there  is  the  subsistence  type 
of  garden,  illustrated  on  page  .  .  .,  which 
normally  produces  all  of  the  vegetables 
and  many  of  the  fruits  needed  for  a  fam¬ 
ily  of  five  or  more.  This  garden  might 
vary  from  one-fourth  to  one-half  acre  in 
size. 


Third ,  a  very  common  type  of  subur¬ 
ban,  backyard,  or  vacant-lot  garden  con¬ 
tains  about  one-twentieth  of  an  acre  or  is 
in  a  plot  30  x  75  feet  in  size.  Such  a  gar¬ 
den,  illustrated  on  the  two  center  pages, 
if  intensively  cultivated,  may  produce 


most  of  the  needed  vegetables  for  a  small 
family  from  early  spring  until  late  fall. 

Fourth ,  there  is  the  small  kitchen 
patch,  available  on  almost  every  city  lot. 
Probably  not  more  than  twenty  feet 
square,  or  about  one  one-hundredth  of  an 
acre,  it  will  provide  the  delights  of  fresh 
vegetables  for  many  meals  and  substan¬ 
tially  reduce  costs  of  living  in  more  popu¬ 
lated  places. 

This  is  to  be  your  garden.  No  one  can 
work  out  a  plan  for  you  in  the  most 
minute  detail,  and  you  probably  would 
not  want  anyone  to  do  so.  Some  sort  of 
plan,  however,  you  must  make,  and  the 
better  your  plan,  the  greater  will  be  your 
joys  of  anticipation  as  well  as  realization. 

Suit  Your  Own  Needs 

Suggestions  for  a  better  arrangement 
and  selection  of  the  vegetables  are  always 
appreciated  even  by  the  most  experienced 
gardeners.  There  are  certain  obvious  simi¬ 
larities  between  all  garden  plans.  There 
are  reasons  for  changing  the  best  of  plans 
to  fit  in  with  your  own  conditions.  The 
suggestions  which  follow  and  the  typical 
garden  plans  shown  in  diagram  and  in 
perspective  should  not  be  copied  in  their 
entirety,  but  instead  you  should  question 
their  application  to  your  plot  of  ground. 

Consider  especially  the  length  of  your 
growing  season  as  it  applies  to  a  suc¬ 
cession  of  two  or  more  crops  in  a  single 
season.  These  plans  and  most  of  the  sug¬ 
gestions  made,  apply  to  the  middle  tem¬ 
perate  zone  in  the  United  States,  but  a 
reference  to  the  map  and  to  the  planting¬ 
time  chart  on  pages  ....  should  at  least 
set  aside  any  qualms  about  what  not  to 
plant.  Answers  to  questions  about  the 


Don’t  start  without  a  plan 


adaptation  of  vegetables  to  your  soil  in  its 
present  state  of  fertility  and  physical  con¬ 
dition  as  regards  drainage  and  water 
supply,  may  be  found  in  the  articles  re¬ 
lating  to  these  subjects.  You  can  then 
better  make  up  your  mind  as  to  "what 
vegetables  should  grow." 

Vegetables  for  a  Victory  Carden 

Successful  and  experienced  gardeners 
do  not  attempt  to  raise  too  great  a  variety 
of  vegetables.  They  have  learned  by 
"hard  knocks"  the  pitfalls  of  "dividing 
their  eggs  into  too  many  baskets.”  Inex¬ 
perienced  gardeners  should  limit  the 
number  of  vegetables  planted  to  those 
that  can  be  cultivated  and  utilized  without 
waste.  This  number  should  probably  not 
exceed  a  dozen  in  any  one  season.  Con¬ 
centration  and  conservation  of  one’s  ef¬ 
forts,  always  important,  are  doubly  impor¬ 
tant  now  in  wartime,  when  it  is  a  sin 
to  waste  seed,  time  and  energy  that  could 
otherwise  better  be  employed  in  our  "all- 
out  war  effort." 


Appeal  to  All 


Don’t  plant  too  many  kinds  of  vegetables 


of  the  first  ten  or  twelve  of  these  selected 
crops,  which  are  here  listed  as  nearly  as 
we  can  evaluate  them  in  order  of  t heir- 
usefulness  to  the  average  home  gardener: 


1 )  Beans 

2)  Tomato 

3)  Lettuce  (Leaf) 

4)  Carrot 

5)  Onion  (Sets) 

6)  Beet 

7)  Radish 

8)  Swiss  Chard 

9)  Cabbage 

10)  Spinach 

11)  Parsley 


12)  Endive 

13)  Sweet  Corn 

14)  Peas 

15)  Kohlrabi 

16)  Kale 

1 7 )  Parsnip 

18)  Broccoli 

19)  Peppers 

20)  Egg  Plant 

21)  Turnip  or 
Rutabaga 


Although  we  will  describe  more  than 
fifty  different  vegetables,  many  of  them 
have  no  place  in  your  garden  and  our  only 
object  in  discussing  them  is  to  include 
vegetables  which  might  have  a  place  in 
some  other  garden  North,  South,  East 
or  West.  There  are,  however,  certain 
vegetables  which  make  a  universal  appeal 
because  of  their  excellence,  ease  of  culture, 
and  extensive  adaptation  to  soils  and  cli¬ 
mates  throughout  the  nation.  These  vege¬ 
table  crops  are  featured  in  the  Garden 
Plans  which  follow  and  are  double 
starred  (**)  in  the  descriptive  text. 
Novices  in  the  art  of  gardening  may  do 
well  to  limit  their  efforts  to  the  culture 


Substitution  may  be  made  of  certain 
similar  vegetables  in  the  same  group, 
such  as  other  cole  crops  for  cabbage  or  of 
shallots  and  leeks  for  onions.  Conditions 
of  soil,  climate,  and  size  of  garden,  or 
more  mouths  to  feed  and  more  free  time 
and  available  labor  might  also  justify 
some  changes  in  the  above  list.  Most  of 
the  single  starred  (*)  vegetables  which 
will  be  discussed  might  readily  be  sub¬ 
stituted  for  the  last  ten  listed,  but  the 
culture  of  vegetables  not  commonly  grown 
in  your  neighborhood  should  certainly  be 
undertaken  only  after  consultation  with 
experienced  vegetable  growers  or  your 
State  Agricultural  Experiment  Station.

This  plan  provides  a  great  variety  of  vitamin-rich,  leafy  vegetables,  and  nutritious  staples  over  a  long  season — with  a  substantial  reserve  for  canning  and  winter 

storage  Longer  rows,  spaced  wider  apart,  reduce  labor  of  both  wheel-hoe  and  hand-hoe  cultivation 


WHERE  TO  GROW  VEGETABLES  *  *  *  *  *  9 


What  Vegetables.  In  making  your  gar¬ 
den  plan,  you  also  have  some  personal 
considerations  affecting  you  and  your  fam¬ 
ily.  So  far  as  possible  you  will  want  to 
grow  vegetables  that  will  be  useful  and 
served  on  your  table.  You  may  also  want 
to  grow  the  crops  which  will  save  you  the 
most  money  and  avoid  planting  those 
which  may  be  cheaper  in  the  market. 

Then  there  are  those  questions  which 
you  must  ask  yourself,  such  as,  "Am  I 
making  my  selections  so  as  to  have  a 
goodly  supply  of  the  four  main  crops  of 
vegetables,  namely,  root  crops,  leafy 
crops,  legumes  such  as  peas  and  beans, 
and  fruit  crops  such  as  tomatoes?"  and 
again,  "Shall  I  be  able,  with  the  help  of 
my  family,  to  prepare  the  ground  that  is 
needed,  keep  my  garden  free  of  weeds, 
water  it  when  necessary,  and  cope  with 
insect  attacks  and  plant  diseases?” 

Having  settled  these  questions  to  your 
entire  satisfaction,  you  can  then  go  into 
the  details  of  the  amount  of  ground  you 
will  allot  to  each  and  every  vegetable. 
This  visualization,  not  unlike  that  of  fur¬ 
nishing  four  bare  walls  with  furniture, 
will  result  in  an  answer  to  your  question 
of  "What  to  Plant?" 

The  Plan  on  Paper.  Having  carefully 
surveyed  your  plot  of  ground,  you  are 
now  ready  to  put  your  plan  on  paper.  A 
diagram,  large  enough  and  drawn  to 
scale,  will  then  not  only  indicate  the 
length  of  your  rows  and  their  proper  dis¬ 
tance  apart,  but  will  also  show  the  par¬ 
ticular  varieties  of  vegetables  and  the  ap¬ 
proximate  time  of  sowing  seeds  or  set¬ 
ting  plants.  Even  though  this  plan  may 
be  subject  to  change,  it  will  be  a  guide 
and  a  great  help  in  laying  out  your  work 
as  the  season  progresses. 

Before  you  start  actual  operations,  you 
must  decide  whether  you  will  limit  your 
work  entirely  to  growing  vegetables  which 


can  be  raised  from  seeds  planted  in  the 
open  ground,  or  whether  you  will  be 
forced  to  raise  plants  indoors  or  buy 
some  with  which  to  execute  your  plans. 
The  suggestions  as  made  in  the  discussion 
of  the  culture  of  the  fifty-one  vegetables 
listed  and  of  those  in  the  illustrated  text 
should  be  helpful. 

What  Varieties  of  Vegetables 

To  avoid  useless  waste  of  time- in  select¬ 
ing  the  particular  variety  of  the  vegetable 
you  will  want  to  grow,  the  experience  of 
neighbors  or  members  of  your  garden 
club  might  prove  to  be  very  helpful. 
Some  varieties  you  may  not  be  able  to 
obtain,  but  there  are  others  which  seeds¬ 
men  consider  standard  and  well  adapted 
for  your  conditions.  There  are  also  literal¬ 
ly  hundreds  of  varieties  of  certain  vege¬ 
tables,  many  of  which  have  only  a  local 
acceptance  or  represent  selected  strains 
of  more  standardized  varieties.  It  is  there¬ 
fore  our  purpose  to  offer  for  your  con¬ 
sideration  improved  and  outstanding 
varieties. 

All-America  Selections.  Typical  of 
advancement  made  by  plant  breeders,  are 
more  than  one  hundred  superior  varieties, 
representing  over  twenty  of  our  most  pop¬ 
ular  vegetables.  These  are  the  All-America 
Selections  which  have  been  awarded  gold, 
silver,  and  bronze  medals  by  a  nation-wide 
committee  of  judges  who  have  studied  the 
growth  habits  of  new  selections  or  hybrids 
for  perfection  of  fruit  or  seed  at  twelve 
or  more  trial  grounds  in  many  parts  of  the 
United  States.  These  varieties  are  fea¬ 
tured  in  the  catalogs  of  many  seedsmen.

SELECTION  OF  SEED 


Now  that  all  plans  for  our  garden  have 

been  made,  most  of  us  will  resume  our 

* 

studies  of  the  seedsmen’s  catalog,  and  we 
shall  be  very  fortunate  if  \ve  do  not  be¬ 
come  further  confused  by  the  glittering 
array  of  varieties  which  are  described  and 


recommended.  Perhaps  some  day  seeds¬ 
men  will  get  together  and  commission 
some  sympathetic  soul  to  write  a  book  on 
"How  to  Read  a  Seedsmen’s  Catalog.” 
More  new  gardens  might  be  made  and 
more  seeds  and  plants  sold.  One  thing  is 
certain — we  must  not  be  confused  by  the 
beautiful  novelty  pages  in  color  and  then, 


in  the  end,  leave  the  decision  to  the  store 
clerk.  We  should  decide  now,  with  the 
aid  of  the  reference  tables,  how  much  seed 
of  each  variety  we  shall  want  to  buy.  We 
hope  that  the  suggestions  made  in  the  suc¬ 
ceeding  chapters  will  at  least  enable  us  to 
make  some  decisions  on  what  not  to  buy. 

Use  Only  Good  Seed.  Assuredly  we 
will  buy  our  seeds  only  from  a  reputable 
seedsman.  This  will  be  our  best  assurance 
for  obtaining  fresh  seed  that  will  not  only 
germinate  but  is  the  best  that  can  be  had 
from  the  standpoint  of  vitality  and  vigor. 
Poor  seed  is  a  bad  investment,  resulting 
in  poor  stands,  waste  of  ground,  or  un¬ 
necessary  replacement  by  reseeding.  If  in 
doubt  about  any  seeds,  test  a  sample  by 
keeping  them  between  wet  blotters, 
counting  the  number  that  germinate  and 
the  percentage  of  germination.  Better 
still,  use  the  Rag  Doll  method  by  placing 
seeds  between  moistened  cloths.  We  shall 
also  want  to  give  preference  to  disease- 
resistant  varieties  and,  if  possible,  pur¬ 
chase  seeds  of  vegetables  that  have  been 
chemically  treated  for  disease  prevention. 
It  is  also  very  important  that  we  select 
those  varieties  of  certain  vegetables  which 
are  known  to  be  adapted  to  our  local  soil 
and  climatic  conditions. 


Make  a  “rag  doll”  for  testing  germination 
before  planting  certain  seeds

THE  SOIL  AND  ITS  PREPARATION 


and  also  providing  a  medium  in  which 
beneficial  soil  bacteria  can  multiply  and 
create  more  favorable  conditions  for  the 
growth  of  plants.  This  speeding-up  of  the 
life  processes  of  soil  will  be  further  ac¬ 
celerated  by  the  annual  use  of  manure, 
lime,  and  fertilizer. 

Preparation  of  Soil.  Assuming  that 
we  have  a  fairly  deep  mellow  loam  with 


Rake  and  roll  for  a  fine  seed 
bed 


The  importance  of  good  soil  has  been 
stressed,  but  most  good  soils  can  and 
should  be  made  better  each  and  every  year. 
Even  more  important  are  the  steps  neces¬ 
sary  for  the  improvement  of  average  or 
poor  soils.  There  will  be  no  essential 
difference  in  the  methods  used  to  achieve 
greater  productiveness  of  either  good  or 
poor  garden  soils,  but  rather  in  the  degree 
of  our  efforts.  Better  drainage  may  be 
obtained  either  by  tile  underdrainage  or 
surface  ditches,  both  to  remove  excess  or 
standing  water,  and  to  maintain  a  water 
level  favorable  to  the  movement  of  water 
down  through  the  upper  two  or  three  lay¬ 
ers  of  soil  and  upwards  to  the  cultivated 
layer.  The  next  step  will  be  to  take  ad¬ 
vantage  of  the  better  physical  condition  of 
the  soil  created  by  drainage  and  further 
improve  its  texture  by  adding  organic 


matter  or  humus  from  well-rotted  manure 
or  from  compost  piles  of  decaying  plants. 
While  we  are  thus  improving  the  texture 
of  our  soil,  we  are  at  the  same  time  adding 
fertility,  including  available  plant  food 


Your  compost  pile  adds  humus — organic  matter 
which  improves  garden  soils

good  drainage,  we  shall  want  to  have  it 
plowed  or  spaded  just  as  early  as  possible. 
This  does  not  mean  that  we  should  stir  the 
ground  before  it  is  dry  enough,  since  even 
some  otherwise  workable  soils  will  be¬ 
come  compacted  and  lumpy,  making  it 
difficult  later  on  to  prepare  a  seed  bed.  If 
you  hire  your  ground  plowed  and  fitted, 
provide  in  your  contract  for  thorough  har¬ 
rowing  or  dragging  and,  if  possible,  the 
removal  of  stones  and  rubbish.  The  prop¬ 
er  depth  of  plowing  or  spading  is  de¬ 
termined  by  good  common  sense.  Under 
no  condition  should  we  bring  up  too  much 
unfertile  subsoil,  but  should  dig  deep 
enough  to  insure  the  penetration  of  roots 
for  a  full  supply  of  plant  food  and  mois¬ 
ture.  The  proper  fitting  of  the  soil  must 
include  the  breaking  up  of  all  clods,  re¬ 
moving  trash  and  pulverizing  the  upper 
two  inches.  The  use  of  either  a  disc  or 
drag  harrow  and  a  roller  will  reduce  the 


Don't  make  a  garden  in  rocky  soil 


number  of  man-hours  of  labor,  although, 
when  seeding  time  comes,  the  use  of  the 
hand  rake  is  usually  necessary.  In  making 
a  new  garden,  if  sodland  is  turned  under, 
it  may  be  best  to  shake  the  dirt  loose  from 
the  sods,  destroy  the  larvae  of  insects,  and 
use  the  residues  in  the  compost  heap. 


MANURE,  FERTILIZER,  AND  LIME 


Animal  Manures .  Both  the  oldtimers 
and  modern  market  gardeners  will  agree 
that  there  is  nothing  better  for  growing 
vegetables  than  good  barnyard  manure, 
and  yet  there  are  many  successful  truck 
farmers  and  gardeners  who  now  rely  al¬ 
together  on  the  use  of  green  crops  turned 
under,  composts,  and  commercial  fer¬ 
tilizer.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  good 
manure  is  both  expensive  and  difficult  to 
obtain.  In  fact,  many  gardeners  are  for¬ 
tunate  if  they  can  secure  enough  fresh 
horse  manure  to  produce  the  necessary 
bottom  heat  for  their  hotbeds,  and  must 
rely  on  electrically  heated  forcing  beds. 
Good  manure  for  use  in  garden  soil 
should  be  well  rotted,  and  manure  with 
too  much  straw  should  be  avoided.  Prob¬ 


ably  greater  benefit  may  be  obtained  from 
manure  by  using  it  in  the  compost  and 
sprinkling  it  with  fifty  to  one  hundred 
pounds  of  superphosphate  to  the  ton  to 
reduce  the  loss  of  ammonia.  Such  well- 
rotted  manure,  reinforced  in  phosphoric 
acid,  may  also  be  applied  as  a  heavy  top 
dressing  (about  one  ton  on  a  30x75 
foot  garden)  before  plowing  or  spading. 
If  fresh  manure  is  used,  a  fall  application 
is  preferable. 

Poultry  and  dried  cow  and  sheep  ma¬ 
nures  are  two  to  five  times  as  concentrated 
as  fresh  horse  or  cow  manure  which  is 
mixed  with  straw  or  bedding  material  and 
should  be  used  accordingly.  All  are  ex¬ 
cellent  sources  of  nitrogen,  but  usually 
are  more  costly  than  fertilizer  for  the  units 
of  plant  food  which  they  supply.

HOW  TO  GROW  A  VICTORY  GARDEN 


*  * 


Commercial  Fertiliser .  Animal 
manures,  however,  are  not  well-balanced 
fertilizers,  and  even  heavy  applications 
may  not  provide  all  of  the  quick-acting 
nitrogen,  available  phosphoric  acid,  and 
potash  needed  for  the  intense  cultivation 
of  vegetable  crops.  The  home  gardener 
cannot  very  well  select  the  especial  fer¬ 
tilizer  analysis  needed  for  certain  crops 
and  therefore  finds  it  quite  satisfactory  to 
use  an  average  analysis.  Thus,  while  it 
might  be  more  profitable  for  him  to  use 
a  fertilizer  furnishing  10%  of  nitrogen 
on  leafy  crops,  and  12%  of  potash  on  root 
crops,  he  will  strike  an  average  and  use 
such  a  fertilizer  as  a  5-8-7  on  everything 
in  his  garden  (5%  nitrogen,  8%  avail¬ 
able  phosphoric  acid  and  7%  potash) . 
One  per  cent  more  or  less  of  phosphoric 
acid  or  potash  may  not  be  so  important; 
but  lower-grade  fertilizers  containing  less 
total  plant  food — and,  especially,  less 
nitrogen — are  not  so  effective,  excepting 
where  heavy  applications  of  animal  ma¬ 
nures  have  been  made.  Where  garden 
loams  have  been  greatly  enriched  with 
nitrogen,  the  recommended  rates  of  ap¬ 
plication  of  fertilizer  may  be  reduced  or 
even  cut  in  half.  Those  exceptional  soils 
which  furnish  too  much  nitrogen  should 
receive  a  special  fertilizer,  such  as  an  0- 
12-12  or  0-20-20,  from  which  nitrogen 
is  omitted. 

Although  specific  suggestions  for  the 
use  of  other  fertilizers,  more  in  accordance 
with  the  demands  of  certain  vegetables, 
are  made  in  discussing  the  culture  of  these 
crops  in  succeeding  chapters,  the  home 
gardener  will  do  well  to  heed  the  follow¬ 
ing  instructions  for  the  use  of  fertilizer.  It 


may  help  him  not  only  to  make  better  use 
of  commercial  plant  food,  but  also  to 
avoid  injury  to  seeds  and  plants. 

How  To  Use  Fertilizer .  On  small 
gardens,  most  of  the  fertilizer  (usually 
fifty  to  one  hundred  pounds  on  a  plot 
30  x  75)  should  be  applied  broadcast 
and  well  worked  into  the  soil  a  week  or 
ten  days  before  making  up  rows  or  plant¬ 
ing  seeds.  On  larger  gardens,  especially 
where  rows  are  farther  apart,  probably 
half  of  the  fertilizer  applied  broadcast 
and  the  other  half  well  mixed  into  the 
row,  especially  for  long  season  crops,  will 
prove  to  be  more  profitable.  The  greatest 
care  must  always  be  used  to  avoid  direct 
contact  of  fertilizer  with  seeds,  seedlings, 
and  plants.  This  also  applies  to  the  use  of 
nitrogenous  side  dressings,  such  as  nitrate 
of  soda,  cyanamide,  and  sulphate  of  am¬ 
monia.  For  leafy  crops,  usually  planted 
with  rows  close  together,  a  pound  per 
hundred  feet  of  row  of  any  of  these  ma¬ 
terials  applied  to  the  soil  alongside,  but 
not  touching  the  plants,  and  repeated 
after  two  or  three  weeks,  is  safer  and 
better  than  one  heavier  application.  Al¬ 
ways  cultivate  the  fertilizer  into  the  soil 
without  disturbing  the  roots.  It  is  more 
economical  to  purchase  fertilizer  in  one 
hundred  or  one  hundred  and  twenty-five 
pound  bags  than  in  small  packages. 

The  TJse  of  Lime.  The  consistent 
use  of  lime  in  growing  vegetables  means 
that  only  the  right  amount  of  lime  should 
be  applied  to  correct  acidity.  Most  garden 
soils  should  receive  an  application  of  one-

half  ton  of  lime  to  the  acre  every  other 
year  over  a  period  of  five  or  six  years,  and 
very  acid  soils  might  receive  two  or  three 
times  this  amount  for  the  first  application 
(100  to  150  pounds  on  a  plot  30  x  75). 
The  proper  amount  to  apply  can  best  be 
determined  by  making  a  test  for  acidity 
yourself  or  having  one  made  by  a 
local  county  agent  or  vocational  teacher. 


TOOLS  AND 

The  essential  tools  for  the  profession 
of  gardening  are,  of  course,  a  spade,  a  hoe, 
an  iron  rake,  a  hand  weeder,  a  trowel,  and 
twenty-five  to  two  hundred  feet  of  cord  or 
twine  for  a  garden  line.  The  owner  of  a 
small  garden  usually  cannot  afford  to 
invest  in  laborsaving  tools,  but  as  your

wish  to  buy  but  very  likely  will  buy 
additional  equipment.  The  longer  rows 
of  larger  gardens  make  the  use  of  a  wheel 
cultivator  with  various  attachments  not 
only  a  convenience  but  almost  a  necessity.

The  home  gardener  will  find  the  use  of 
hydrated  lime  both  more  expedient  and 
more  effective,  although  if  agricultural, 
pulverized  or  ground  limestone  is  more 
readily  obtained,  approximately  fifty  per 
cent  more  of  this  material  should  be  used 
than  of  hydrated  lime.  Hydrated  lime 
can  be  purchased  from  almost  any  hard¬ 
ware  store  or  builders’  supply  house. 


EQUIPMENT 

both,  may  also  be  needed  to  combat  in¬ 
sects  and  plant  diseases.  There  are  other 
rather  inexpensive  small  tools  which  will 
prove  very  useful,  such  as  the  narrow- 
bladed  hoe,  spading  or  manure  fork,  and 
combination  rake  and  roller.  An  exten¬ 
sion  for  the  lawn  or  garden  hose  may  be 
necessary,  while  a  wheelbarrow  and  fer¬ 
tilizer  distributor,  always  useful,  would  be 
optional  equipment  for  larger  gardens.  In 
the  final  analysis,  resort  to  the  use  of  the 
hand  hoe  is  inevitable  and  even  hand 
weeding  may  decide  the  issue  of  success 
or  failure. 

There  are  many  excellent  tools  for  spe¬ 
cialized  gardening  and  also  gadgets  of 
more  limited  usefulness  which  are  seldom 
purchased  by  practical  gardeners.  Good 
tools,  properly  cared  for,  will  last  many 
years,  and  good  gardeners  will  never 
blame  their  tools  for  crop  failures.

WHEN  AND  HOW  TO  SEED  AND  PLANT 


The  "when  and  how"  of  vegetable 
gardening  are  closely  associated  in  both 
thought  and  act.  Although  there  are 
general  principles  which  apply  to  the 
time  and  method  of  planting  all  vege¬ 
tables,  and  others  to  certain  classes  of 
vegetables,  the  successful  home  gardener 
will  eventually  come  to  know  the  growing 
habits  of  his  plants  so  well  that  he  will 
apply  his  knowledge  of  the  "how  and 
when"  to  each  and  every  crop  that  he 
grows. 

When  to  Plant.  Good  gardeners 
no  longer  wait  for  the  'light  of  the  moon" 
to  plant  seed  or  set  plants,  but  they  will 
nevertheless  be  very  insistent  on  planting 
things  as  nearly  at  the  right  time  as  pos¬ 
sible.  By  keeping  "ahead  of  their  work" 
instead  of  behind,  they  will  always  be 
ready  when  the  spring  opens  up  and  good 
common  sense  indicates  that  it  is  safe 
to  plant  any  particular  vegetable.  This 
preparedness  program  not  only  provides 
for  having  the  soil  ready  and  in  good 
condition  for  seeding  but  for  making  the 
necessary  arrangements  for  seeds  and 
plants.  Those  gardeners  who  have  the 


time  and  space  for  gardens  of  a  half  acre 
or  more,  can  well  afford  either  to  start 
their  seeds  indoors  or  in  a  hotbed.  This 
applies  especially  to  the  growing  of  plants 
which  produce  their  edible  portions  for 
us  during  the  spring  and  early  summer, 
but  also  applies  to  certain  vegetables,  like 
celery,  which  could  not  be  grown  from 
seed,  particularly  in  northern  climates. 

Starling  Plants  Indoors.  Seeds  are 
usually  planted  in  flats  or  boxes  contain¬ 
ing  two  or  three  inches  of  soil  (l/3  each 
of  sand,  leaf  mold,  and  garden  soil).  Seed 
is  usually  planted  thickly  in  rows  only 
about  two  inches  apart  and  then  trans- 


Don’t  plant  seed  too  deep 


17  *  *  *  *  *  * 

planted  two  or  three  days  after  the  first 
true  leaves  appear,  either  to  other  flats 
or  pots  with  richer  soil.  Spotting  boards, 
such  as  shown  in  the  illustration,  and  a 
dibble  or  pointed  peg,  provide  regular 
spacing  of  a  half  to  two  inches  apart  for 
the  transplanted  plants.  These  are  usually 
set  to  the  depth  of  the  first  seed  leaves, 
thoroughly  watered,  firmly  packed  and 
protected  from  the  sun.  Before  these 
transplanted  plants  are  ready  for  the 
garden,  they  are  gradually  hardened  off 
by  lowering  the  temperature  and  reduc¬ 
ing  the  water  supply.  A  cold  frame  is 
used  for  this  purpose. 

Outdoor  Hotbeds .  An  outdoor  hot¬ 
bed  can  easily  be  constructed  by  sinking 
into  the  ground  a  wooden  frame  banked 
with  fresh  manure.  These  frames  are  usu¬ 
ally  3  feet  x  6  feet  in  size,  sloping  from 
a  height  of  16  inches. in  the  back  to  8 
inches  in  the  front.  Half-sized  frames  are 
also  obtainable,  as  well  as  their  glass  sash 
covers.  A  layer  of  from  six  to  ten  inches 
of  fresh  well-watered  and  packed  horse 
manure  is  used  as  a  base  for  five  or  six 
inches  of  good  garden  topsoil.  After  the 
frame  is  covered  with  a  sash  of  glass, 
plants  should  not  be  set  until  the  tempera¬ 
ture  drops  to  an  average  of  90  degrees. 
Otherwise  plants  transferred  may  wilt  and 
die. 

Cold  Frames.  Cold  frames  are  usually 
filled  with  only  three  or  four  inches  of 
manure  and  less  topsoil,  but  otherwise 
are  similar  to  hotbeds,  except  that  they 
are  more  often  used  for  spotting  and 
hardening  plants  grown  in  the  greenhouse 
before  they  are  set  out  in  the  garden.  De- 


Transplant  seedlings  into  pots  or  hotbeds 


sired  temperatures  for  both  hotbeds  and 
cold  frames  are  maintained  by  raising  the 
sash  during  the  heat  of  the  day  and  by 
covering  with  hay  or  straw  at  night. 

Planting  Seed  in  the  Open 
Ground .  To  avoid  waste  of  seed  and  the 
labor  of  replanting  later  on,  no  seed 
should  be  sown  in  a  soil  which  is  too  wet 
or  which  has  not  been  properly  pulver¬ 
ized.  Even  though  the  seeds  of  certain 
vegetables,  like  peas,  beets,  cabbages, 
onions,  lettuce,  and  spinach,  will  germi¬ 
nate  at  soil  temperatures  of  50  degrees  or 
less,  or  even  stand  freezing  temperatures, 
time  will  be  gained  by  waiting  until 
"spring  opens  up."  Moisture  is  essential 
for  germination,  and  although  hard-coated 
seeds,  like  peas  and  beans,  may  be  soaked 
before  planting,  it  is  usually  better  to  wet 
down  the  furrows  and  cover  the  seeds  im¬ 
mediately  after  planting,  to  conserve  mois¬ 
ture.  Sowing  after  rather  than  before  a 
rain,  especially  on  heavier  soils,  is  the 
better  practice,  if  the  soil  is  inclined  to 
bake.  The  crusts  which  will  form  under 
these  conditions  should  be  promptly 
broken  with  the  rake.  Firming  of  the 
seed  bed  after  planting,  by  tamping  with 
the  rake  or  roller  attached  to  the  seed 
drill,  or  by  tramping  with  the  feet,  is  a 
universal  practice  and  applies  particularly 
to  lighter  loams  and  sandy  soils.

"shoe”  on  the  wheel  cultivator,  if  you 
have  one  of  the  right  size  and  type. 

Thinning  and  Transplanting.  A 

certain  amount  of  thinning  of  plants  after 
germination  is  almost  inevitable,  even 
when  the  optimum  amount  of  seed  is 
planted.  Plants  that  grow  in  crowded 
rows  become  spindly  and  stunted  in  early 
life  owing  to  unnecessary  competition 
with  one  another.  The  strong,  healthy 
plants  should  always  be  allowed  to  sur¬ 
vive.  The  number  of  plants  to  be  left  in 
the  row  depends  not  only  on  the  particu¬ 
lar  crop,  but  on  the  different  varieties 
which  vary  in  their  growth  habits.  Al¬ 
though  it  is  possible  to  utilize  certain 
plants  removed  in  the  thinning  process  by 
transplanting  them  under  favorable  condi¬ 
tions,  certain  plants  like  carrots,  parsnips, 
and  salsify  resist  transplanting  in  open 
ground.  Roots  of  many  plants  which  are 
removed  without  sufficient  adhering  moist 
soil  should  be  immediately  "puddled”  or 
dipped  into  a  thin  paste  of  soil  and  water 
and  then  transferred  at  once  to  their  new 
abode.  The  roots  should  not  be  exposed 
to  the  air  even  for  a  short  period.  Trans-

Experience  as  Your  Guide 

In  general,  seeds  should  be  sown  thick¬ 
ly  enough  so  that  proper  spacing  is  as¬ 
sured  after  the  thinning  process  which 
follows  germination.  Although  the 
amount  of  seed  to  sow  can  be  determined 
in  a  general  way  by  reference  tables  or 
instructions  on  the  seed  packet,  the  good 
judgment  of  the  gardener  is  usually  a 
product  of  experience  with  seeds  sown 
either  too  sparingly  or  too  thickly.  When 
too  many  seeds  are  sown,  there  may  be 
a  loss  of  plants  from  disturbing  the  roots 
at  thinning  time.  Seeds  of  root  crops 
should  be  sown  relatively  thin,  but  an 
excess  of  seed  is  desirable  in  making  up 
hills  for  melons,  cucumbers,  and  squash. 

The  use  of  a  tape  measure  or  a  rod  or 
stick  marked  off  into  feet  and  inches  will 
enable  you  to  stretch  the  garden  line  for 
the  marking  off  of  straight  rows  at  equal 
distances  apart.  The  furrows  to  be  made 
for  small  seeds  are  then  made  either

Intercropping.  In  the  plans  laid  out 
for  our  gardens,  we  provided  for  a  suc¬ 
cession  of  crops  in  order  to  make  the 
best  possible  use  of  every  square  foot  of 
ground,  but  did  not  definitely  plan  on 
companion  crops  or  the  growing  of  rows 
of  early  crops  in  between  some  of  the 
slower  maturing  sorts  like  broccoli  or 
cabbage.  This  is  an  optional  practice,  and 
may  be  followed  out  either  by  a  separate 
seeding  or  by  utilizing  plants  transplanted 
from  a  seed  bed  or  by  salvaging  the  "thin¬ 
nings.” 

Marker  row  crops,  such  as  radishes  in 
the  same  row  with  carrots  or  parsnips,  are 
sometimes  called  partnership  crops,  but 
this  term  is  also  used  for  the  less  desir¬ 
able  practice  of  growing  pole  beans  in  the 
com  hill.  Why  not  call  all  such  crops 
"Buddy  Crops”? 


planting  solutions  prepared  from  chemical 
hormones  are  helpful  with  certain  crops. 
It  is  usually  a  good  practice  to  set  trans¬ 
planted  plants  down  nearly  to  their  first 
true  leaves  and  to  firm  the  well-moistened 
ground  about  them.

CULTIVATION  AND  IRRIGATION 


All  gardens  must  be  cultivated  and  most 
of  them  will  be  benefited  by  irrigation  or 
watering  during  certain  seasons  of 
drought,  and  it  is  even  profitable  to  fre¬ 
quently  supplement  the  natural  rainfall, 
even  though  this  may  not  be  absolutely 
necessary  to  prevent  wilting  or  starvation 
for  lack  of  plant  food. 

Cultivation,  A  good  hoeing  some¬ 
times  is  worth  even  more  than  a  light 
shower.  Hoeing  should  follow  almost 
immediately  after  a  light  rain,  but  never 
while  the  soil  is  still  sticky.  Remember 
that  insects  and  small  bad  boys  are  not 
the  only  thieves  of  the  garden.  Weeds  are 
usually  arch  criminals.  Cultivation  is  also 
advisable  even  if  there  are  no  weeds,  for 


regardless  of  theories  of  the  value  of  cul¬ 
tivating  soil  for  aeration  and  free  move¬ 
ment  of  water,  we  know  that  the  practice 
of  hand  hoeing  is  profitable.  One  good 
rule  would  be  to  cultivate  at  least  once  a 
week.  We  should  at  all  times,  however, 
avoid  such  deep  cultivation  as  may  cause 
injury  to  the  roots  of  plants,  keeping 
uppermost  in  mind  the  killing  or  uproot¬ 
ing  of  weeds  before  they  become  estab¬ 
lished.  There  is  a  satisfaction  in  getting 
the  best  of  weeds  rather  than  allowing 
them  to  get  the  best  of  us.  Look  upon 
them  as  robbers  that  steal  the  moisture 
and  fertility  needed  for  our  crops  and, 
furthermore,  often  harbor  harmful  insects 
and  fungus  diseases. 

Irrigation,  Most  green  plants  con¬ 
tain  from  eighty- five  to  ninety-five  per 
cent  of  water,  but  the  amount  of  actual 
water  in  them  is  only  a  very  small  frac¬ 
tion  of  the  amount  that  is  needed  during 
the  processes  of  their  growth.  The  intake 
of  water  through  their  roots  and  its  trans¬ 
piration  through  the  leaves  from  birth  to 
fruiting  time  is  enormous.  This  water 
must  be  supplied,  and  if  nature  is  not 
kind  in  providing  it  through  rainfall,  or  if 
the  moisture  does  not  penetrate  the  soil, 
or  is  lost  through  drainage,  some  sort  of 
irrigation  must  be  practiced.

Water  for  the  Garden .  Although 
the  amount  of  water  and  the  frequency  of 
application  to  the  garden  will  vary  accord¬ 
ing  to  natural  rainfall  and  the  type  of  soil, 
we  must  be  guided  by  the  needs  of  vege¬ 
tables  some  of  which  require  much  more 
water  than  others.  Habits  of  growth  and 
development  of  root  systems  have  much 
to  do  with  this.  Most  root  crops  send  their 
roots  downward  after  moisture  and  may 
not  suffer  like  shallow  rooted  leafy  vege¬ 
tables.  The  home  gardener  might  better 
take  a  chance  on  the  side  of  "too  much" 
water  than  not  enough.  This  does  not 
mean  watering  the  garden  too  often,  but 
rather  giving  it  a  good  soaking  to  in¬ 
duce  penetration  to  a  depth  of  at  least 
three  inches.  To  be  really  effective,  water 
should  be  applied  in  one  place  until  it 
soaks  into  the  soil,  and  mere  sprinkling 
should  be  avoided  since,  like  a  light 


shower,  it  brings  the  roots  to  the  surface 
where  they  may  be  scorched  by  the  sun. 

In  dry  weather  it  is  a  good  plan  to 
make  shallow  furrows  with  the  hoe,  along¬ 
side  of  plants  so  that  water  will  run  to 
them  rather  than  away  from  them.  The 
irrigation  of  the  garden  by  means  of  open 
ditches  is  only  practical  where  the  seepage 
of  the  water  is  toward  the  roots  of  the 
plants  and  the  run-away  will  be  so  gradual 
that  available  water  will  not  be  lost. 
Occasionally  good  gardens  are  located  on 
soils  where  the  water  table  may  be  within 
eighteen  to  thirty  inches  of  the  surface, 
and  it  may  be  necessary  to  provide  per¬ 
manent  ditches  at  intervals  of  twenty  or 
thirty  feet  to  lower  the  water  level.  Tile 
drainage  is  usually  the  better  solution  in 
gardens  that  have  too  much  water.

WAR  ON  INSECTS  AND  PLANT  DISEASES 


Preparedness,  to  meet  the  onslaughts  of 
insect  enemies  and  the  numerous  diseases 
that  may  attack  our  garden  vegetables,  will 
win  the  battles  and  final  victory.  Home 
gardeners,  however,  should  not  be  dis¬ 
couraged  from  planting  gardens  because 


they  think  they  do  not  have  or  cannot 
afford  the  "implements  and  munitions" 
needed  for  the  job.  There  are  many 
simple  remedies  for  repelling  or  killing 
insects.  Seeds  may  be  purchased  that  have 
already  been  treated  to  prevent  "damping

Don’t  let  the  bugs  beat  you 


off”  at  germination  time.  Materials  for 
combating  fungus  and  other  plant  para¬ 
sites  are  relatively  cheap,  and  many  gar¬ 
deners  come  to  rely  on  only  two  or  three 
chemical  treatments,  such  as  the  copper- 
rotenone  dust,  the  bordeaux  mixture,  and 
the  simpler  remedies  known  to  all  gar¬ 
deners.  Although  specific  treatments  are 
described  in  the  section  on  our  common 
vegetables,  and  formulas  for  mixing  them 
are  shown  on  page  .  .  .  . ,  some  general 
suggestions  should  simplify  our  under¬ 
standing  of  "Garden  Defense”  measures. 

Preventive  Treatment.  "Alert” 
number  one  should  be  sounded  before  the 
plow  or  the  spade  is  used  in  your  garden. 
The  execution  of  our  orders  may  include 
the  destruction  of  all  trash  that  has  har¬ 
bored  insects.  After  the  garden  is  plowed 
or  spaded  either  in  the  fall  or  early  spring, 
do  not  cultivate  or  fit  it  until  a  few  days 
before  you  are  ready  to  seed  and  plant. 
Then,  insofar  as  possible,  either  buy 
treated  seed  or  treat  according  to  direc¬ 
tions  with  copper  or  organic  mercury  dusts 
so  that  you  may  avoid  seed-borne  diseases. 

"Alert”  number  two  may  be  sounded 
when  certain  plants  are  just  coming 
through  the  ground,  and  you  will  avert 
disaster  either  by  placing  poisoned  bait  or 


Hand-pick  ’em — when  necessary 


by  thorough  dusting  after  the  first  true 
leaves  appear. 

"Alert”  number  three  may  be  sounded 
at  any  time  during  the  growing  season; 
and  even  though  you  find  your  "enemy 
at  your  gates,”  your  preparedness  with 
nicotine  dust  or  spray  will  enable  you  to 
kill  aphids  or  lice.  If  a  mobile  army  of 
leaf-chewing  insects  descends  under  cover 
of  darkness,  you  will  have  your  spray  gun 
or  dusting  gun  ready  and  loaded  with 
rotenone,  pyrethrum,  or  a  combination 
bordeaux-arsenate  mixture. 


Immediate  action  on  your  part  will 
rout  the  enemy.  Perhaps  no  amount  of 
spraying  or  dusting  will  get  rid  of  all  of 
the  cutworms  and  "borers  from  within,” 
but  they  can  be  rooted  out  bodily  and  de¬ 
stroyed.  A  good  rule  to  follow  is  to  take 
nothing  for  granted  but  to  be  ready  at  the 
sound  of  the  "alert”  and  keep  your  guns 
trained  so  as  to  shoot  underneath  the 
leaves  as  well  as  on  top  if  you  want  to 
eliminate  all  of  the  "snipers.”

(9)  cornear  worms,  (10)  tomato  hornworms 


Seed  Treatments.  Pre-treatment  to 
disinfect  seed  and  kill  fungi  and  bacteria 
varies  with  the  crop,  type  of  seed,  and 
number  of  infections  to  be  controlled. 
Thus,  two  or  more  different  treatments 
may  be  necessary  for  some  vegetable 
seeds.  Although  protective  against  soil- 
borne  diseases,  seed  treatments  do  not 
take  the  place  of  soil  sanitation  and  weed 
eradication.

ment  of  melon,  cucumber,  squash,  and 
tomato  seed  with  a  1-2000  solution  of 
deadly  poisonous  corrosive  sublimate 
should  precede  dusting  with  red  copper

Many  home  gardeners  and  some  professionals  are  relying  more  and  more  on  either  rotenone 
or  pyrethrum  dusts  and  sprays  for  most  leaf-eating  and  some  sucking  insects.  These  dusts  are 
not  normally  poisonous  to  animals  or  humans,  but  should  preferably  be  purchased  in  the 
proper  strength  and  used  according  to  the  recommendations  of  the  manufacturer.  Success  is 
also  reported  from  the  use  of  commercial  copper  rotenone  mixtures  for  the  control  of  both

HARVEST  AND  STORAGE  OF  VEGETABLES 


Having  grown  your  vegetables  to  their 
most  delectable  eating  stage,  it  might 
seem  to  be  just  a  matter  of  pulling  them 
or  yanking  them  from  their  vines  and 
throwing  them  into  the  pot.  Unfortunate¬ 
ly,  even  professional  gardeners  are  some¬ 
times  careless  in  picking  or  pulling,  with 
the  result  that  roots  are  broken  off  in  the 
ground  and  vines  are  injured  or  killed 
by  rough  handling.  In  heavy  soils,  it  will 
pay  to  use  the  spade  or  a  large  trowel  in 
lifting  roots,  especially  tenacious  ones 
like  carrots  or  parsnips;  and  children 
should  be  especially  cautioned,  in  picking 
beans  or  peas,  so  that  vines  will  be  care¬ 
fully  protected  with  one  hand  when  pods 
are  snapped  off  the  vines  with  the  other. 

Winter  Storage.  During  the  grow¬ 
ing  season,  home-grown  vegetables  in 
reality  should  not  be  "stored”  at  all,  but 
plucked,  prepared,  cooked,  and  served 
without  delay.  Otherwise  they  should  re¬ 
ceive  the  same  treatment  as  vegetables 
from  the  market,  which  should  always  be 
stored  in  a  cool,  humid  place.  Some  of 
them,  like  asparagus  and  many  leafy  vege¬ 
tables,  should  either  be  stood  in  water  or 
sprayed  to  preserve  their  crispness. 


Winter  storage  of  vegetables  may  have 
no  place  in  the  modern  scheme  of  living 
of  some  suburban  gardeners  who  do  not, 
have  unheated  portions  of  their  cellars 
or  who  do  not  find  it  practical  to  open  up 
pits  for  cabbage  or  root  crops  during  the 
winter.  Neither  will  they  want  to  dig 
into  frozen  ground  for  parsnips,  salsify  or 
other  roots  which  are  often  sweeter  al¬ 
though  frozen.  Even  those  who  do  have 
unheated  cellars  may  well  give  more  care¬ 
ful  attention  to  moisture  and  temperature 
conditions.  Carrots,  beets  and  other  root 
crops  may  be  stored  in  sand  to  prevent 
their  drying  out,  but  ventilation  as  well 
as  a  low,  constant  and  above-freezing 
temperature  always  is  a  prime  requisite. 
Thus,  if  a  room  is  partitioned  off  from  a 
heated  cellar,  it  must  not  only  be  insu¬ 
lated,  but  provided  with  at  least  one 
window  for  ventilation.  Shelves  for  crates 
and  boxes  or  open  bin  space  are  a  matter 
of  choice.  Outdoor  storage  cellars  espe¬ 
cially  constructed  with  ventilators  which 
can  be  opened  at  night  and  closed  in  the 
day,  and  also  storage  pits  or  banks,  are 
described  in  U.S.D.A.  Farmers’  Bulletin 
No.  879.  More  detailed  instructions  are 
given  in  other  circulars  and  bulletins.

HOW  TO  GROW  A  VICTORY  GARDEN 


*  *  * 

FRUITS  FOR  THE  CARDEN 


One  of  the  questions  which  might 
arise  or  which  may  be  suggested  by  some 
member  of  the  family  will  be,  "What 
about  growing  some  fruits  in  our  garden?" 

Although  not  often  practical  in  the 
smaller  home  gardens,  there  are  condi¬ 
tions  where  fruits  might  be  grown  even 
to  the  exclusion  of  vegetables.  The  fruits 
which  you  might  want  to  consider  are 
perennials,  which  will,  of  course,  require 
pruning,  thinning,  resetting,  and  fertiliz¬ 
ing.  A  certain  amount  of  seasonal  work 
is  necessary  for  their  successful  culture, 
but  you  may  not  be  required  to  give  fruits 
the  constant  and  consistent  attention  re¬ 
quired  by  vegetables. 

Perennial  Fruits.  Although  straw¬ 
berries  may  be  the  first  to  suggest  them¬ 
selves,  a  row  or  two  of  raspberries  or 
blackberries  can  often  be  placed  along  the 
fence  or  with  other  perennial  crops,  where 
they  will  not  interfere  with  the  culture  of 
vegetables.  Included  with  raspberries  are 
the  Dewberries,  Loganberries,  Boysenber- 
ries,  Youngberries  and  other  hybrids  of 
these  cane  fruits — all  of  them  well 
adapted  for  home  gardens.  An  arbor  or  a 
trellis  might  just  as  well  be  used  for  two 
or  three  grapevines  of  some  favorite  varie¬ 
ties  adapted  to  your  conditions  The  plant¬ 
ing  of  tree-fruits  should  rather  be  con¬ 
sidered  apart  from  the  home  garden, 
although  there  are  dwarf  varieties  of  such 


fruits  as  the  peach,  cherry,  quince,  and 
pear  which  may  be  planted  in  gardens 
without  producing  either  too  much  shade 
or  creating  a  drain  on  the  fertility  of  soil 
even  when  interplanted  with  leafy  vege¬ 
tables. 

Strawberry .  A  home  size  strawberry 
patch  might  consist  of  four  25-foot  rows 
which  would  require  about  one  hundred 
plants  if  the  rows  are  three  feet  apart  and 
the  plants  set  one  and  a  half  feet  apart 
in  the  row,  or  double  this  number  if 
planted  in  twin  rows  for  a  more  matted 
growth.  Although  plants  may  be  set  either 
in  the  spring  or  in  the  early  fall,  most 
gardeners  will  want  to  set  their  plants  in 
the  spring  to  insure  the  all-season  growth 
needed  for  a  small  harvest  the  following 
spring.  Plants  should  be  set  so  that  the 
crowns  are  even  with  the  surface  of  the 
soil,  which  should  be  firmly  packed  about 
the  roots.  Tillage  of  the  soil  should  be 
thorough  to  keep  down  weeds  even  until 
the  first  hard  frost.  It  is  assumed  that  the 
soil  of  the  strawberry  bed  has  been  en¬ 
riched  with  manure  and  fertilizer  and  that 
the  acid  soils  are  moderately  sweetened 
with  lime. 

The  home  gardener  has  the  opportunity 
of  selecting  many  delectable  varieties  that 
are  seldom  available  in  the  markets,  but 
he  should  make  certain  that  his  selection 
is  from  varieties  known  to  be  adapted  to 
his  locality.  This  information,  if  not 
locally  available,  can  readily  be  obtained 
from  your  State  Agricultural  Experiment 
Station.  Moreover,  only  those  varieties 
should  be  planted  which  are  known  to 
produce  perfect  flowers.  Otherwise  fruit 
would  not  set  unless  a  few  plants,  bearing 
these  perfect  pollen  producing  blossoms, 
are  interspersed  among  "imperfect"  ones.

FRUITS  FOR  THE  GARDEN  *  *  *  *  *  *  27 


The  winter  protection  of  strawberry 
vines  is  important  in  all  excepting  our 
southern  tier  of  states.  The  time  of  apply¬ 
ing  a  mulch,  whether  it  be  of  hay,  straw 
or  pine  needles,  is  also  important.  This 
mulch  should  not  be  applied  until  the 
plants  have  become  well  hardened  in  the 
fall.  Severe  injury  often  follows  if  not 
mulched  before  the  temperature  reaches 
fifteen  degrees  Fahrenheit. 

Cane  Fruits .  It  is  well  to  think  twice, 
if  not  three  times,  before  setting  out  rasp¬ 
berries  or  blackberries,  and  this  is  particu¬ 
larly  true  for  those  living  south  of  the 
Mason-Dixon  Line.  Raspberries  are  at 
their  best  in  the  cooler  regions  of  the 
country,  but  only  the  hardiest  varieties 
can  be  grown  in  the  colder  parts  of  the 
northeastern  and  north  central  states  where 
temperatures  do  not  normally  go  below 
fifteen  degrees  below  zero.  Blackberries 
have  a  much  greater  range,  and  the  Lucre- 
tia  and  Young  Dewberries  do  very  well 
in  the  South. 

Culture .  It  is  advisable  to  open  a 
trench  and  work  both  manure  and  fer¬ 
tilizer  well  into  the  soil  before  setting 
either  of  these  cane  fruits.  Raspberries  are 
spaced  about  three  feet  apart,  and  black¬ 
berries  three  and  one-half  to  four  feet. 
Only  roots  that  are  free  of  crown  gall  and 
other  diseases  should  be  used,  and,  soon 
after  growth  starts,  stakes  or  trellises 
should  be  provided  for  both  blackberries 
and  raspberries.  Mulching  with  straw  or 
coarse  litter  to  conserve  moisture  and  keep 
down  weeds  is  always  good  practice  and 
heavy  winter  mulching  is  essential  in  the 
colder  climates. 

Only  those  varieties  recommended  for 
your  locality  should  be  considered,  al¬ 
though  there  are  some  newly  developed 
fruits,  including  the  Youngberry  and 


Boysenberry,  which  can  be  grown  under 
varied  soil  and  climatic  conditions. 


Grapes.  A  single  row  of  five  or  six 
grapevines  can  be  planted  across  a  fifty- 
foot  lot,  or  two  or  three  vines  may  be 
grouped  on  arbor  or  trellis  where  they  will 
blend  with  ornamental  plantings.  Usually 
one-year-old  vines  are  planted  eight  or 
ten  feet  apart,  and  on  reasonably  rich 
soil  should  produce  a  few  bunches  of 
grapes  the  second  year  after  planting.  Suc¬ 
cess  with  grapes  depends  upon  careful 
pruning  to  twenty  buds  or  less  on  three- 
year-old  vines,  or  double  this  number 
when  well  established.  In  the  South, 
Scuppernong  and  Thomas  varieties  are 
suggested,  although  Concord  Catawba, 
Moore’s  Early,  and  Niagara  are  all  ex¬ 
cellent  table  grapes  for  northern  gardens. 
Consultation  with  county  agricultural 
agents  or  experiment  stations  concerning 
the  varieties  of  fruits  best  adapted  to  your 
locality  should  be  very  helpful,  although 
commercial  nurseries  are  always  pleased 
to  render  this  service.

FIFTY-ONE  VEGETABLES 


Artichokes 

Globe  Artichoke .  Neither  of  the 
two  distinct  types  of  artichokes,  Globe 
and  Jerusalem,  is  as  popular  with  home 
gardeners  as  each  might  well  be.  The 
Globe,  French  or  Burr  Artichoke — a 
perennial  member  of  the  Thistle  family 
—can  be  successfully  grown  in  good  rich 
soils  throughout  the  South  and  even  in 
the  latitude  of  Chicago  if  given  winter 
protection  by  covering  with  straw  or  coal 
ashes. 

Culture .  Edible  flower  heads  may 
even  be  produced  from  seed  the  first 
year  if  plants  are  started  under  glass  in 
February  or  early  March,  potted  and  set 
in  the  open  when  danger  of  frost  is  past. 
Once  established,  artichokes  can  be  propa¬ 
gated  by  replanting  root  divisions  or 
suckers.  The  rows  in  the  garden  should 
be  at  least  3^2  ^eet  apart  and  the  plants 
spaced  20  to  30  inches  in  the  row.  The 
plants  are  cut  down  to  within  8  or  10 
inches  of  the  crown  in  the  late  fall  for 
another  season’s  bloom.  Flowever,  for  the 


larger  and  more  luscious  edible  flowers, 
new  plants  should  be  set  at  least  every 
third  year.  The  Globe  Artichoke  com¬ 
mends  itself  both  to  more  experienced  and 
more  adventurous  gardeners  who  must, 
however,  nurture  it  with  great  care  and 
ample  supplies  of  plant  food.  At  least 
y4  pound  of  5-8-7  fertilizer,  thoroughly 
mixed  with  the,  soil  in  the  hills  and  around 
the  plant,  will  encourage  succulent 
growth. 

Jerusalem  Artichoke.  This  useful 
vegetable,  although  more  often  grown  by 
farmers  for  stock  food,  has  a  high  nutri¬ 
tive  value,  and,  when  properly  prepared 
for  the  table,  is  relished  by  many  people. 
Excellent  yields  of  the  edible  roots  of  this 
sister  of  the  sunflower  are  readily  ob-

The  flower  bud  is  the  edible  portion  of  the  Globe 

artichoke 

tamed,  and  they  may  be  easily  stored  to 
substitute  for  baked  potatoes  during  the 
winter. 

Culture .  The  tubers  are  cut  and 
planted  after  the  fashion  of  potatoes  in 
the  very  early  spring  (March  or  April) 
and  spaced  twelve  to  fifteen  inches  apart 
in  rows  separated  by  about  2 y2  t0  3  feet. 
The  tubers  may  even  be  left  in  the  ground 
to  be  dug  and  used  when  the  weather 
permits.  The  Jerusalem  Artichoke  has  a 
place  in  some  Victory  Gardens  as  an  eco¬ 


nomical  source  of  home-grown  food,  but 
should  not  be  planted  unless  you  like  it 
and  your  family  will  eat  it. 

Asparagus  * 

Literally  millions  of  home  gardens, 
farm  and  suburban,  should  have  an  aspara¬ 
gus  bed.  In  fact,  it  has  a  place  in  almost 
every  permanent  garden  with  the  excep¬ 
tion  of  those  located  on  very  heavy,  com¬ 
pact  soils.  Properly  maintained,  a  bed  of 
four  hundred  square  feet  will  provide  a 
small  family  with  two  or  three  messes  a 
week  during  the  average  cutting  season 
of  two  and  one-half  months,  although  if 
daily  harvests  are  wanted,  with  a  reserve 
for  canning,  the  bed  should  be  at  least 
1 5  x  40  feet.  Two  hundred  and  fifty  roots 
will  plant  this  area.  With  proper  care, 
an  annual  production  over  ten  or  twelve 
years  may  reasonably  be  expected. 

Culture .  Although  the  roots  may  be 
grown  from  seed,  even  professional  gar¬ 
deners  prefer  to  buy  one-year-old  roots 
which  they  plant  in  trenches  eight  to  ten 
inches  deep.  The  roots  are  covered  to  a 
depth  of  two  inches  and  soil  is  then  grad¬ 
ually  filled  in  as  the  roots  grow.  The  top 
growth  is  cut  down  in  the  late  fall,  but 
the  asparagus  shoots  are  not  cut  until  the 
third  year,  and  then  for  a  short  season  of 
five  or  six  weeks.  The  spears  are  har¬ 
vested  with  a  short  knife,  by  cutting 
just  below  the  surface  of  the  soil.  Cutting 
should  cease  early  in  July  and  the  shoots 
should  be  allowed  to  develop  their  normal

growth  of  leaves,  flowers  and  berries. 
Kept  free  from  weeds  throughout  the 
summer  and  well  supplied  with  plant 
food,  the  roots  will  then  develop  and  store 
up  the  reserve  food  needed  for  strong, 
straight  shoots  for  our  good  health  and 
enjoyment. 

Fertilizer.  Well-rotted  manure  should 
not  only  be  placed  in  the  bottom  of  the 
trench  and  mixed  with  the  soil  before 
setting  roots,  but,  if  available,  should  be 
used  as  a  mulch  between  the  rows  and  cul¬ 
tivated  into  the  soil.  The  use  of  at  least 
ten  bushels  of  manure  and  twenty  pounds 
of  a  4-8-10  fertilizer  on  the  four-hundred- 
foot  bed  is  advisable.  Apply  fertilizer 
broadcast  and  wash  it  in  to  a  depth  of 
live  or  six  inches.  Follow  up  this  applica¬ 
tion  each  year  with  two  ten-pound  top 
dressings,  one  in  the  early  spring  before 
the  first  cultivation,  and  the  other  after 
"laying  the  crop  by’’  for  summer  growth. 
These  semi-annual  applications  should  be 
applied  two  feet  on  either  side  of  the  row 
and  cultivated  in  as  deeply  as  possible 
without  disturbing  roots. 

Varieties.  Home  gardeners  should 


follow  the  example  of  professionals  in 
planting  rust-resistant  varieties.  Either 
Mary  Washington,  developed  by  the  late 
Dr.  J.  B.  Norton  of  the  U.  S.  Department 
of  Agriculture,  or  the  somewhat  earlier 
strain,  Martha  Washington,  should  prove 
satisfactory,  although  the  new  variety, 
Paradise,  has  been  developed  for  both  rust 
resistance  and  larger  yields. 

Diseases  and  Insects.  The  one  fly  in 
the  ointment  in  growing  asparagus  is  not 
a  fly  at  all,  but  one  or  both  of  two  beetles 
which  feed  on  the  tender  tips  of  the 
leaves.  The  common  asparagus  beetle  and 
the  twelve-spotted  asparagus  beetle  are 
controlled  either  with  a  four  per  cent 
rotenone  solution  or  a  dust  of  a  1-5  mix¬ 
ture  of  calcium  arsenate  and  hydrated 
lime.  Should  rust  develop,  a  measure  of 
control  is  obtained  by  dusting  with  sul¬ 
phur  every  two  or  three  weeks  after  the 
last  cutting  and  throughout  the  summer, 
and  then  in  the  fall  all  of  the  diseased 
plants  should  be  burned.  Watch  for  the 
orange  and  black  blisters  on  the  stalks 
and  leaves  which  are  forerunners  of  turn¬ 
ing  yellow  and  dying. 


Beans  *  * 


Beans  should  not  be  omitted  from  the 
family  garden  since  they  are  dependable, 
and  good  judgment  in  their  planting  will 
insure  a  supply  of  vegetables  even  when 
other  crops  may  fail.  Then  there  is  variety 
even  in  beans  if  you  know  your  beans. 
You  may  have  your  choice  of  snap  beans, 
either  green  or  wax,  heavy-yielding  pole 
beans,  and  bush  or  pole  limas;  then,  if 
you  have  some  extra  ground,  you  can 
plant  some  shell  beans  for  the  winter  sup¬ 
ply.  Culture  is  simple.  Plant  only  after 


:?  ;  ft'*-  >-'r>  »  '  ''  |§|$|§|  ,  VC  I! 


the  danger  of  frost  is  past  and  for  green 
or  snap  beans,  up  to  the  first  of  August  in 
localities  where  frost  does  not  appear  be¬ 
fore  September  20th. 

Bush  Beans .  These  are  usually  sown 
in  drills  two  and  one-half  to  three  feet 
apart  and  planted  one  and  a  half  or  two 
inches  deep.  Also,  the  seed  may  be  sown 
in  double  rows  four  feet  apart.  Then  in 
the  process  of  thinning  the  plants  to  three 
inches  apart  in  the  row,  take  care  to

eliminate  all  the  weak  ones.  It  is  well  to 
break  the  crust  of  the  soil  with  a  rake 
just  before  the  seedlings  are  due  to  ap¬ 
pear.  Beans  respond  to  a  high-potash  fer¬ 
tilizer,  and  10  pounds  of  4-8-10  mixed  in 
the  100-foot  row  is  profitable. 

Green  Beans .  Select  from  a  score  of 
good  stringless  varieties  of  green  podded 
beans,  Giant  Stringless  Green  Pod,  or  the 
original  Burpee’s  Stringless  Greenpod, 
originated  by  the  famous  Calvin  Keeney 
(the  father  of  stringless  beans) .  The  All- 
America  Silver  Medal  selection  of  Com¬ 
modore  might  well  head  our  list.  If  you 
want  them  extra  early,  the  Plentiful  and 
Bountiful  strains  are  very  good.  Tender- 
green  is  also  a  heavy  yielder,  although 
either  the  Red  or  Black  Valentine  String-  . 
less  varieties  may  be  slightly  more  resis¬ 
tant  to  light  frosts. 

Wax  Beans.  When  it  comes  to  wax 
beans,  you  may  have  your  choice  of 
Keeney’s  Rustless  Golden  Wax  or  Pencil 
Pod  Black  Wax.  Do  not  hesitate  to  plant 
Golden  Bountiful  or  Gold  Standard  or, 
for  extra-early  wax  beans,  Henderson’s 
Golden  Age.  Then  there  are  the  string¬ 
less  Kidney  Wax  varieties,  also  originated 
by  Calvin  Keeney,  and  Round  Pod  Kidney 
Wax,  all  of  which  are  good,  but  some  one 
may  do  best  under  your  own  local  con¬ 
ditions. 

Pole  Beans.  Though  less  hardy  than 
the  bush  varieties,  pole  beans  should  be 
planted  six  or  eight  to  the  pole  (poles 
previously  set  in  the  ground)  and  then 
thinned  to  three  or  four  of  the  strongest 
plants.  About  two  pounds  of  seed  are 
needed  for  one  hundred  and  fifty  poles. 
The  poles  are  usually  set  about  3x4  feet 
apart.  As  soon  as  the  first  runners  appear, 
tie  loosely  with  string  or  cotton  cloth  and 


Don’t  let  pole  beans  black  out  your  spinach 


keep  the  intervening  ground  free  of  weeds 
and  Crabgrass. 

Kentucky  Wonder  and  Old  Homestead 
are  the  old  stand-bys,  both  stringless  when 
young,  although  more  rust  and  mosaic 
resistance  is  claimed  for  a  new  variety, 
Golden  Gate  Wax,  which  is  stringless  at 
all  stages  of  growth.  In  the  South,  where 
pole  beans  are  more  popular,  a  new  intro¬ 
duction  by  the  Alabama  Experiment  Sta¬ 
tion  known  as  Alabama  No.  1,  is  resistant 
to  root-knot  nematodes  as  well  as  drought 
and  adverse  conditions.  Among  other  pole 
beans,  more  often  grown  for  winter  stor¬ 
age,  are  the  Horticultural,  Cranberry,  and 
Lazy  Wife,  and  the  Ideal  Market,  some¬ 
times  known  as  Black  Valentine  Pole  and 
Black  Cornfield. 

Lima  Beans.  Both  bush  limas  and 
pole  limas  have  their  places  in  the  home 
garden  and  should  be  planted  a  little 
later  than  other  beans,  even  though  they 
require  more  time  for  maturity.  Of  the 
two,  bush  limas  are  earlier  although,  in 
view  of  the  larger  yield  of  pole  limas,  am¬ 
bitious  home  gardeners  should  not  hesitate 
to  set  a  few  poles.

Don’t  let  Jack,  the  Bean  Beetle,  climb  up  your 

bean  stalk 

Bush  Lima  Beans .  Bush  limas  have 
been  developed  to  fulfill  many  ideals  of 
size,  disease  resistance,  and  flavor.  The 
original  Fordhook  Bush  is  still  standard, 
but  the  U.  S.  D.  A.  has  improved  the 
original  Henderson  Bush,  which  is  now 
marked  as  U.  S.  D.  A.  Henderson  Num¬ 
ber  2.  Then  there  is  the  Baby  Fordhook, 
which  is  a  cross  between  the  original 
Henderson’s  Baby  Lima  and  Fordhook. 
The  All-America  Silver  Medal  winner, 
Baby  Potato,  resulting  from  a  selection  by 
Dr.  Huelsen  of  the  University  of  Illinois, 
is  a  very  thrifty,  productive  sort.  There 
are  also  green-seeded  varieties  of  the 
Henderson  Bush  Lima  developed  for 
higher  vitamin  A  content. 

Pole  Lima  Beans.  The  ideal  pole 
lima  may  not  yet  have  been  produced ;  but 
such  excellent  varieties  as  Succulence,  Le¬ 
viathan,  Henderson’s  Ideal,  King  of  the 
Garden,  Florida  Butter,  Sieva,  and  Im¬ 
proved  Challenger,  all  have  special  merits 
according  to  location.  For  a  dependable 
supply,  pole  limas  planted  early  are  a 
"better  bet’’  for  the  home  gardener  than 
bush  limas. 


GROW  A  VICTORY  GARDEN 


Fava  or  Broad  Windsor  Bean, 

Sometimes  called  English,  Giant  Butter, 
Italian,  and  Horse  Bean — this  distinct 
species  should  be  planted  in  rows  three 
feet  apart,  spaced  four  inches  in  the  row. 
Heavy  yields  of  glossy  pods  with  five  or 
six  flat  pea-flavored  beans  will  account 
for  its  rapid  increase  in  our  markets  and 
home  gardens.  The  pods  are  not  edible, 
but  the  shelled  beans  are  delectable  fresh 
or  dried  for  winter. 

Diseases  and  Insects 

The  principal  pest  of  beans,  and  espe¬ 
cially  lima  beans,  is  the  Mexican  Bean 
Beetle,  both  the  larvae  and  adults  of 
which  not  only  feed  on  the  foliage,  but 
work  underneath  the  leaves  and  some¬ 
times  attack  the  stems.  The  home  gar¬ 
dener  can  reduce  the  ravages  of  this  im¬ 
ported  pest  by  destroying  the  eggs,  making 
frequent  pickings.  Otherwise,  use  a  poi¬ 
sonous  spray,  but  not  before  the  pods 
begin  to  fill.  Four  per  cent  rotenone  solu¬ 
tion  or  a  y4  per  cent  derris-rotenone  dust 
should  be  thoroughly  applied  every  week 
or  ten  days  until  the  beetles  disappear. 

Beans  sometimes  are  also  subject  to 
bacterial  blight  and  halo  blight,  and  if 
you  see  brown  or  brick-red  spots  on  the 
leaves  or  stems,  you  have  not  planted  a 
resistant  variety.  Powdery  mildew  is  a 
fungus  producing  a  cobwebby,  powdery 
mold  on  the  leaves  and  pods,  and  downy 
mildew,  affecting  both  the  stalks  and 
leaves  of  both  pole  and  bush  limas,  is  a 
typical  mold.  No  satisfactory  control 
measure  for  downy  mildew  or  pod  blight 
is  known,  but  powdery  mildew  can  be 
checked  by  the  use  of  sulphur  dust  or 
spray.  Bean  seeds  should  always  be  treated 
with  Cuprocide  or  other  copper  dust  be¬ 
fore  planting.

Beet  *  * 

The  contribution  of  the  beet  botii  for 
table  use  and  canning  in  the  home  gar¬ 
dener’s  family  is  exceeded  by  only  a  very 
few  other  root  crops.  Although  naturally 
a  cool  season  or  temperate  climate  crop, 
beets  can  be  grown  throughout  the  South 
during  the  cooler  seasons.  Though  slow 
to  get  off  to  a  start,  those  small,  tender, 
young  beets  are  usually  ready  for  the  pot 
in  sixty  days.  Beets  are  also  lime-loving, 
although  an  excess  of  lime  or  the  use  of 
toe  much  manure  favors  the  development 
of  scab — those  rough  "pox  marks"  resem¬ 
bling  potato  scab. 

Culture.  In  order  to  make  up  for 
delayed  or  poor  germination,  the  seeds 
should  be  sown  thickly,  or  at  least  not 
over  one  inch  apart,  in  rows  fourteen  to 
eighteen  inches  apart.  Radish  seed  may 
be  sown  with  the  beet  seed  to  mark  the 
rows,  which  may  be  only  slightly  ridged, 
especially  on  lighter  soils.  Plants  should 
be  thinned  before  they  tend  to  crowd  each 
other.  Leave  from  three  to  six  inches 
between  plants,  depending  upon  the  vari¬ 
ety  and  whether  you  prefer  the  small, 
sweet,  tender  specimens  or  the  larger 
beets — for  table  use,  pickling,  or  canning. 
Extra-early  beets  can,  of  course,  be  ob¬ 
tained  from  transplanted  plants  seeded 
under  glass  six  or  eight  weeks  before 
transplanting.  Transplanted  thinnings  are. 
very  useful  for  filling  up  void  spaces  in 
the  garden.  Shallow  and  frequent  culti¬ 
vation  for  weed  control  will  enable  us 
to  avoid  injury  to  the  roots.  Good  economy 
will  dictate  the  use  of  tender  beet  tops 
for  "greens,”  which  will  taste  better  be¬ 
cause  they  have  been  grown  in  "our  home 
garden.” 

Fertilizer .  The  yield  of  beets  will  be 


greatly  increased  by  the  use  of  plenty  of 
potash  in  the  fertilizer;  and  an  analysis 
furnishing  approximately  four  per  cent 
nitrogen,  eight  per  cent  phosphoric  acid, 
and  ten  to  twelve  per  cent  potash,  is  pref¬ 
erable  to  that  of  average  garden  fertilizer. 
Such  fertilizer  should  be  well  mixed  with 
the  soil  and  to  a  good  depth  before  pre¬ 
paring  the  rather  shallow  furrows  needed 
for  seeding  beets.  Four  to  five  pounds  per 
one  hundred  feet  of  row  is  a  moderate 
application. 

Varieties.  The  home  gardener  will 
probably  prefer  the  Early  Wonder  or 
Crosby  Egyptian,  although  the  Detroit 
Dark  Red  is  preferred  where  both  a  good 
crop  of  roots  and  "tops  for  greens"  are 
desired.  Asgrow  Wonder,  Little  Marvel, 
and  Perfected  Detroit  are  also  good  home 
garden  varieties. 

Broccoli 

There  are  two  types  of  broccoli,  and 
one  of  them,  Cauliflower  Broccoli,  closely 
resembles  cauliflower  excepting  that  the 
heads  require  much  longer  to  develop  and 
the  crop  is  even  more  sensitive  to  un¬ 
favorable  weather  conditions.  Its  culture 
is  largely  confined  to  the  region  of  the 
Gulf  States  and  Oregon  and  California, 
where  the  plants  will  carry  through  the 
winter  and  develop  heads  in  early  spring. 

Sprouting  Broccoli.  This  has  be¬ 
come  very  popular,  not  only  because  of 
its  green  color  and  greater  vitamin  con¬ 
tent,  but  because  there  is  less  grief  in  its 
culture.  Nevertheless,  the  same  favorable 
soil  and  climatic  conditions  favor  the  full 
development  of  sprouting  broccoli.  Seeds 
are  usually  planted  indoors  about  ten 
weeks  before  planting  in  the  spring,  or 
sown  in  the  open  for  a  fall  crop.  The

Green,  sprouting  broccoli  ranks  high  in  vitamins 
and  minerals 


heads  should  be  cut  before  the  green 
flower  clusters  fully  develop.  The  home 
gardener  can  well  consider  broccoli  ahead 
of  cauliflower,  since  he  will  find  the  tender 
leaves  about  the  stem,  as  well  as  the  sec¬ 
ondary  flower  clusters  which  develop  after 
the  first  cutting,  a  good  substitute  for 
other  greens.  Italian  Green  Sprouting  or 
Calabrese  is  the  most  common  variety. 

Brussels  Sprouts  * 

By  many  considered  to  be  the  most 
delicate  member  of  the  cabbage  family, 
Brussels  sprouts  are  susceptible  to  kind 
treatment  by  the  home  gardener.  Al¬ 
though  the  plants  are  less  hardy  than 
cabbage,  seed  sown  under  glass  in  Feb¬ 
ruary  may  be  set  in  the  ground  during 
April;  or,  for  the  fall  crop,  seed  sown  in 


May  is  usually  ready  to  be  set  out  by  June 
15th.  Plants  are  usually  set  in  rows  two 
and  one-half  to  three  feet  apart  and  about 
eighteen  inches  apart  in  the  row.  Cultiva¬ 
tion  of  the  deep,  rich,  moist  soil  is  essen¬ 
tial  for  rapid  growth,  which  can  be  further 
hastened  by  the  liberal  use  of  stable 
manure  and  fertilizer,  with  one  or  two 
side  applications  of  nitrate  of  soda  or 
sulphate  of  ammonia. 

The  diminutive  heads  that  develop  on 
the  stalk  are  usually  harvested  from  the 
bottom  up  and  a  supply  from  a  single 
planting  will  provide  a  quantity  of  these 
nutty  little  cabbages  over  a  period  of 
weeks.  The  leading  variety  is  Long  Island 
Improved. 

Cabbage  *  * 

Although  commercially  the  most  im¬ 
portant  of  the  cole  crops,  cabbage  has  a 
place  in  the  home  garden  only  if  the  room 
it  takes  up  is  not  needed  for  other  vege¬ 
tables.  Early  cabbages  require  less  space 
than  late,  and  a  single  row  can  well  fur¬ 
nish  you  with  a  dozen  or  fifty  compact 
heads  of  vitamin-rich  food.  When  they 
are  out  of  the  way,  your  ground  is  avail¬ 
able  for  late  tomatoes,  late  beans,  potatoes, 
or  other  winter  storage  crops. 

Culture .  Early  cabbage  plants  may  be 
set  16  to  20  inches  apart  in  the  row,  and 
the  rows  spaced  as  close  as  2l/>  feet  apart. 
If  a  ball  of  moist  soil  is  compacted  about 
the  root,  the  plant  set  to  a  depth  of  the 
first  true  leaf,  then  watered  and  protected 
from  the  sun  for  a  day,  rapid  growth  will 
be  assured  and  little  cultivation  aside  from 
clearance  of  weeds  will  be  necessary.  Late 
varieties  should  be  set  two  to  three  feet 
apart  in  the  row  and  the  rows  spaced  three 
feet  apart.

Fertilizer .  Before  setting  plants,  ap¬ 
ply  ten  pounds  of  4-8-8  or  4-8-10  fer¬ 
tilizer  to  100  feet  of  row,  thoroughly  mix¬ 
ing  it  with  the  soil,  or  if  obliged  to  set 
plants  without  fertilizer,  apply  the  same 
quantity  in  4-inch  bands,  two  inches  from 
the  plant,  and  cultivate  into  the  soil.  A 
side  dressing  of  two  pounds  per  100  feet 
of  row  of  nitrate  of  soda,  or  sulphate  of 
ammonia,  three  weeks  after  planting  will 
usually  insure  a  more  rapid  succulent 
growth.  Unless  you  have  applied  all  of 
the  lime  needed  to  correct  acidity  of  your 
entire  garden,  an  additional  application  of 
four  pounds  of  hydrated  lime  per  100  feet 
thoroughly  mixed  into  the  row  should 
help  you  obtain  a  better  response  from 
the  use  of  fertilizer. 

V arieties.  So  far  as  possible,  only  yel¬ 
lows-resistant  varieties  should  be  grown 
Of  the  early  varieties,  yellows-resistant 
strains  of  Early  Jersey  Wakefield  (Jersey 
Queen),  Charleston  or  Early  Winning- 
stadt  will  give  you  your  choice  of  conical 
green-headed  sorts ;  or  if  you  prefer  round 
or  flat  cabbage,  Early  Dwarf  Dutch, 
Golden  Acre  or  Copenhagen  Market  will 
put  you  in  the  professional  class,  with 
more  solid  white  cabbage.  Should  you 
plant  some  intermediate  or  late  cabbage, 
Globe  Flollander,  Danish  Ball-Head,  Penn 


State  Ball-Head,  many  Drum  Head 
varieties,  and  also  Premium  Flat  Dutch, 
are  excellent.  Other  good  ones  like  Glory 
of  Enkhuizen,  Wisconsin  Hollander,  Wis¬ 
consin  Ballhead  and  Wisconsin  All  Season 
are  yellows-resistant.  Many  home  gar¬ 
deners  prefer  to  use  their  ground  either 
for  the  crinkly-leaved  Savoy  or  for  red 
cabbage.  Chieftain,  Improved  America, 
and  Benito  Savoy  are  justly  favorites.  The 
usual  red  varieties  are  Red  Head,  Mam¬ 
moth  Rock  Red,  Red  Drum  Head,  and  al¬ 
so  the  yellows-resistant  Red  Hollander. 

Diseases  and  Insects .  Owing  to  war¬ 
fare  by  several  insects,  bacterial  and  other 
diseases,  cabbage  plants  should  be  grown 
only  from  seed  which  has  first  been 
treated  with  the  proper  corrosive  sub¬ 
limate  solution  and  then  with  zinc  oxide 
or  Semesan.  If  cabbage  maggots  are  found 
about  the  roots,  moisten  the  soil  with  a 
solution  of  corrosive  sublimate  (1  to 
1000),  using  y2  teacupful  per  plant  every 
week  or  ten  days.  Use  derris  dust  or  der- 
ris  spray  to  combat  the  cabbage  worm  and 
cabbage  looper.  If  calcium  arsenate  dust 
is  used,  guard  against  poisonous  residues 
on  the  foliage.  In  some  sections  the  Har¬ 
lequin  cabbage  bug,  although  dangerous, 
can  be  controlled  by  handpicking  or  strong 
contact  sprays  of  whale-oil  soap.

plant  some  Chinese  cabbage? 


Chinese  Cabbage .  The  increasing 
popularity  of  Chinese  or  Celery  Cabbage 
is  no  doubt  due  to  its  use  both  as  a  salad 
and  as  a  pot  herb.  Owing  to  its  tendency 
to  go  to  seed  if  planted  in  spring,  plants 
are  not  usually  set  in  the  North  until  late 
July  or  early  August.  Seed  may  be  planted 
in  seed  beds  or  open  ground  during  June 
or  early  July  and,  when  very  small,  may  be 
thinned  to  a  stand  of  only  fifteen  or  twenty 
inches  apart.  The  control  of  the  usual 
insects  by  means  of  arsenical  poisons  is 
not  considered  safe  for  Chinese  Cabbage, 
and  rotenone  or  pyrethrum  formulas  are 
therefore  suggested.  Chihili  and  Pe  Tsai 
(or  Chokurei)  are  dependable  early  head- 
ing  types,  and  Paoting  is  a  shorter,  stout, 
oval  variety  especially  adapted  for  warmer 
summers  or  for  culture  in  the  South.

Cantaloupe 
( Muskmelons) 

If  wishes  were  melons,  most  home  gar- 
deners  would  certainly  have  a  patch  in 
the  back  yard.  Cantaloupes,  however,  will 
have  a  place  in  our  gardens  only  if  we 
have  land  not  needed  for  more  essential 
vegetables.  Our  soil  and  climate  must  also 
be  favorable,  if  failure  is  to  be  avoided 
and  a  supply  of  luscious  melons  assured. 
The  lighter  loams  or  sandy  soils  usually 
produce  the  best  quality  of  fruit,  but  by 
selecting  the  right  varieties,  good  melons 
can  often  be  grown  on  well-drained  clay 
loams  which  have  been  enriched  by 
manures  and  other  organic  matter.  Am¬ 
ple  soil  moisture  must  be  provided 
throughout  a  warm  growing  season. 

For  an  early  crop  or  in  the  cooler  short 
growing  season  parts  of  the  country,  seed 
may  be  started  under  glass  in  paper  pots, 
but  plants  should  not  be  set  in  the  garden 
until  soil  is  well  warmed  and  after  all 
danger  of  frost  is  over.  More  often  the 
seed  is  sown  after  all  danger  of  frost  is 
over  in  specially  prepared  hills  five  to  six 
feet  apart  each  way.  The  hills  are  prepared 
by  thoroughly  mixing  a  shovelful  of  well- 
rotted  manure  and  a  handful  of  high- 
grade  fertilizer  with  the  soil.  Ten  or  a 
dozen  seeds  are  planted  at  varying  depths 
of  one  or  two  inches,  but  well  covered 
with  soil.  The  plants  that  survive  insect 
attacks  are  narrowed  down  to  two  or  three 
and  carefully  cultivated  and  dusted  or 
sprayed  to  ward  off  insects  and  disease. 
Cultivation  of  the  soil  should  be  effected 
with  little  disturbance  of  the  vines. 

Preparedness  against  insects  and  disease 
will  include  the  usual  contact  sprays 
for  lice.  Copper  sprays  and  dusts  (Cupro- 
cide  or  bordeaux-copper  formulas)  will 
aid  in  the  control  of  Downy  Mildew  and 
bacterial  wilt.  Treatment  of  the  seed

before  planting,  with  the  standard  corro¬ 
sive  sublimate  solution  and  cuprous  oxide 
or  Semesan,  is  almost  a  prerequisite  to 
prevent  "damping  off."  The  spread  of 
mosaic  or  virus  diseases  is  checked  by 
dusting  the  plants  in  the  early  stages  of 
growth  with  a  1  to  20  mixture  of  calcium 
arsenate  and  either  gypsum  or  lime. 

Varieties.  The  home  gardener  now 
not  only  has  his  choice  between  several 
good  green-  and  yellow-fleshed  varieties, 
but  can  utilize  some  of  the  disease-resistant 
strains  developed  for  commercial  growers, 
such  as  the  Improved  Hale  Best  Nos.  45 
and  36,  developed  by  the  Department  of 
Agriculture  especially  for  the  Southwest, 
for  resistance  to  the  powdery  mildew 
disease.  Honey  Rock,  Sugar  Rock,  Hearts 
of  Gold,  and  Milwaukee  Market  are  excel¬ 
lent  yellow-  and  salmon-fleshed  varieties. 
Green-fleshed  melons  do  not  offer  so  large 
a  choice,  but  rust-resistant  strains  of 
Rockyford  or  Netted  Gem  have  more  uni¬ 
versal  acceptance.  Honey  Gold  introduced 
by  Edward  Lowden  of  Hamilton,  Ontario, 
is  a  small,  thick-fleshed  melon  which  is 
well  adapted  for  gardens  on  heavier  soils. 

Carrot  *  * 

No  home  garden  would  be  complete 
without  a  goodly  supply  of  carrots  planted 
for  a  succession  which  can  be  achieved 
both  by  planting  at  different  dates  and  by 
a  choice  of  varieties. 

Culture .  Although  light,  sandy  loam 
soils  produce  the  smoothest  and  straightest 
carrots,  all  deep  loam  soils  (except  the 
heaviest  clays)  will  produce  satisfactory 
crops.  Enormous  yields  are  produced  on 
muck  soils.  The  home  gardener  is  in¬ 
terested  in  growing  the  tender  and,  so 
far  as  possible,  the  coreless  varieties.  For 


Vitamin  A  for  man  and  beast 


the  extra-early  crop,  seeds  are  usually 
planted  in  rows  about  twelve  inches  apart, 
and  the  seed  is  sown  along  with  radishes 
to  mark  the  rows.  The  first  thinning  may 
leave  the  plants  only  one  to  two  inches 
apart.  This  will  make  it  possible  to  pull 
those  plants  which  develop  edible  roots 
thirty  to  forty  days  after  seeding.  This 
will  then  enable  the  more  backward  seed¬ 
lings  to  rapidly  develop  sizable  roots.  A 
seeding  every  ten  days  until  the  middle 
of  June,  and  with  different  varieties,  will 
provide  carrots  throughout  the  summer, 
late  fall  and  winter.  Careful  weeding  and 
cultivation  and  artificial  irrigation  will 
usually  reward  the  home  gardener  and 
make  it  possible  to  pull  his  carrots  without 
breaking.  In  heavy  soils,  a  spade  or  large 
trowel  may  be  required  to  lift  them. 

Fertilizer.  Like  all  root  crops,  carrots 
require  plenty  of  potash  for  satisfactory 
development,  and  a  4-8-10  fertilizer  is 
usually  preferable  to  the  average  5-8-7 
garden  mixture.  If  fertilizer  is  broadcast 
and  disked  in,  at  least  forty  pounds  per 
one  thousand  square  feet  should  be  used ; 
or  if  applied  in  the  rows,  one  half  of  this

quantity  thoroughly  mixed  in  the  soil  be¬ 
fore  seeding  would  be  preferable.  Soils 
that  are  acid  should  be  limed,  but  carrots 
do  not  require  so  much  lime  as  beets 
and  some  other  root  crops. 

Of  the  many  varieties  available  you 
might  well  choose  either  Nantes,  Touchon, 
or  Coreless,  of  the  round  stump-rooted 
sorts;  or  the  longer  strains  of  Chantenay, 
Imperator,  and  Perfection,  for  the  long, 
tapering,  bunching  type  of  carrot  that  is 
preferred  in  our  markets.  Supreme  Half- 
Long  and  Claudia  are  also  good  home 
garden  types.  Carrots  are  remarkably  free 
from  insect  attack  and  plant  diseases. 

Cauliflower 

More  cauliflower  would  be  planted  in 
home  gardens  were  it  not  for  the  many 
failures  of  otherwise  successful  gardeners 
to  develop  sizable  compact  heads  of  this 
more  refined  cole  crop.  Many  gardeners 
have  favorable  soil  conditions  and  even 
the  cool  weather  which  favors  this  crop, 
but  do  not  have  the  low  humidity  and  suf¬ 
ficient  soil  moisture  essential  to  the  best 
development  of  cauliflower. 

Cauliflower  is  less  hardy  than  cabbage 
or  broccoli  and  is  usually  set  about  the 
same  time  as  late  cabbage,  during  the 
month  of  June.  Plants  are  set  approxi¬ 
mately  the  same  distance  apart  and  in  the 
same  way  as  cabbage.  Clean  tillage  must 
be  practiced  without  disturbing  the  root 
systems,  and  the  blanching  of  the  heads 
is  accomplished  by  loosely  tying  the 
leaves  over  the  young  heads  in  such  a 
way  as  to  protect  them  from  the  sun  and 
enable  them  to  shed  water.  Twine  or 
loose-fitting  rubber  bands  may  be  used. 
After  two  or  three  weeks,  but  before  the 
heads  or  curds  become  riced  or  dis¬ 
colored,  they  may  be  cut  the  same  as 
cabbage. 


Cauliflower  plant  with  leaves  tied  up  to  shade 

the  head 

Success  with  cauliflower  depends  also 
on  a  liberal  supply  of  plant  food.  To 
encourage  uninterrupted  growth,  a  top 
dressing  with  nitrate  of  soda  and  the  use 
of  up  to  a  ton  per  acre  of  a  high-potash 
fertilizer  such  as  4-8-8  or  4-8-10  will  be 
especially  beneficial  if  the  soil  has  been 
sweetened  with  sufficient  lime.  Well- 
rotted  manure,  if  available,  is  especially 
beneficial  on  sandy  soils. 

Control  of  insects  and  diseases  com¬ 
mon  to  cabbage  and  all  the  cole  crops 
applies  to  cauliflower,  and  in  some  locali¬ 
ties  it  is  advisable  to  include  ten  to 
twenty  pounds  of  borax  to  the  acre  in  the 
fertilizer  to  prevent  the  browning  of  the 
heads. 

Celeriac  * 

Celeriac  (turnip-rooted  celery)  is  a 
horticultural  variety  of  the  celery  species 
that  develops  roots  averaging  about  three 
inches  in  thickness.  Considering  its  use¬ 
fulness  for  flavoring  other  vegetables  and 
as  a  salad,  as  well  as  the  fact  that  it  pro¬ 
vides  another  useful  root  for  winter  stor¬ 
age,  home  gardeners  might  very  well 


LET  US  NOT  WASTE  A  DAY,  AN  HOUR,  OR  EVEN  A  MINUTE 


is

*  *  M  *  *  41 


grow  some  celeriac,  even  if  they  do  not 
attempt  the  growing  and  blanching  of 
celery. 

Culture.  Culture  is  like  that  for 
celery,  the  early  plants  either  being  start¬ 
ed  under  glass  in  the  North  or  in  open 
ground  in  latitudes  where  there  is  time 
to  mature  a  crop.  The  crisping  and 
the  whitening  of  the  roots  are  attained  by 
protecting  them  with  soil  until  ready 
for  use. 

Celery  * 

The  knack  of  growing  celery  is  easily 
acquired,  but  a  rich,  moist,  well-drained 
soil  is  absolutely  essential.  Ideal  condi¬ 
tions  are  those  provided  by  well-manured, 
deep,  and  rich  sandy  loam  or,  better  still, 
the  typical'peat  or  muck  soil.  On  upland 
soils,  a  mulch  of  stable  manure  between 
the  rows  will  eliminate  weeding  and 
cultivation  and  furnish  some  plant  food 
to  supplement  the  rather  heavy  applica¬ 
tion  of  fertilizer  which  successful  truck 
farmers  and  gardeners  use  on  this  crop. 
As  much  as  a  ton  to  the  acre,  or  ten 
pounds  per  one  hundred  feet  of  row  of 
a  5-8-7  on  average  loams,  or  five  pounds 
of  an  0-8-24  on  muck  soils,  conforms  to 
common  practice.  The  use  of  one  to  three 
top  dressings  of  nitrate  of  soda  or  sul¬ 
phate  of  ammonia  is  also  a  common  prac¬ 
tice  (about  one  pound  per  one  hundred 
feet  of  row)  .  To  prevent  crackstem,  espe¬ 
cially  on  muck  soils,  from  twenty  to 
thirty  pounds  of  borax  is  often  mixed 
with  a  ton  of  fertilizer. 

Culture.  Celery  seed  is  usually  sown 
in  flats  indoors  or  in  the  hotbed  and 
transplanted  outdoors  after  the  second 
pair  of  leaves  appear.  Seed  may  be  grown 
in  the  open  for  the  fall  crop,  but  the 


Enormous  crops  of  celery  like  this  are  grown  on 

muck  soils 


home  gardener  will  usually  want  to  buy 
his  plants  and  set  them  during  late  July 
or  early  August.  Cultivation  should  be 
confined  to  necessary  weed  control,  and 
mulching  with  straw  or  manure  is  con¬ 
sidered  a  good  practice.  Irrigation  should 
supplement  the  normal  supply  of  mois¬ 
ture  essential  to  uninterrupted  growth. 
Early  in  fall  the  gradual  ridging  or  throw¬ 
ing  of  the  soil  to  the  base  of  the  plant 
finally  results  in  blanching  and  crisping 
the  stalks.  Ten-  or  twelve-inch  boards 
may  be  placed  on  edge  on  either  side 
of  the  row,  but  the  home  gardener  may 
prefer  to  purchase  individual  paper  wrap¬ 
pers  or  tubes  to  provide  the  shade  and 
protection  needed  to  perfectly  blanch  the 
stalks.  In  two  or  three  weeks  your  celery 
is  ready  for  the  table  or  may  be  stored 
for  winter  use. 

The  home  gardener  should  select  vari¬ 
eties  of  celery  proved  to  be  successfully 
grown  in  his  locality.  Golden  Plume  and 
Early  Fortune  are  popular  early  varieties, 
but  the  new  Michigan  Golden  is  no  doubt 
the  best  yellows-resistant  strain.  If  you 
are  interested  in  celery  for  late  fall  use

and  winter  storage,  the  fine  quality  of 
Giant  Pascal  is  sure  to  please,  although 
Utah,  Emperor,  Winter  Queen,  and  Crisp- 
heart  are  justly  favorites.  New  and  good 
varieties  of  Pascal  types  are  Summer  Pas¬ 
cal,  Epicure,  and  fusarium-resistant  Cor¬ 
nell  6  and  Cornell  19. 

Swiss  Chard  *  * 

This  foliage  beet,  like  New  Zealand 
spinach,  provides  a  supply  of  "greens” 
without  the  destruction  of  the  plant. 
"Mess  after  mess”  of  the  outer  leaves 
can  be  removed  without  stopping  the 
growth.  Therefore,  it  follows  that  only  one 
planting  is  necessary.  Furthermore,  the 
home  gardener  will  be  assured  of  a  lot 
of  "fodder”  in  the  form  of  a  tasty  pot 
herb  or  vegetable.  A  few  feet  of  row  in 
the  garden  will  supply  a  large  family. 

Culture.  Swiss  chard  is  grown  very 
much  like  beets,  excepting  that  a  greater 
spacing  should  be  allowed  between  plants 
to  permit  expansive  growth.  A  rich 
soil  will  promote  lush  growth,  and  side 
dressings  of  nitrate  of  soda  or  sulphate 
of  ammonia  should  supplement  the  com¬ 
mercial  fertilizer  suggested  for  beets. 
Since  there  are  no  serious  diseases,  and 
insect  attacks  are  rare,  why  not  consider 
growing  some  chard  in  your  garden? 

Chive 

Every  home  gardener  or  even  the  city 
flat  dweller  can  grow  his  own  chives,  and 
have  a  supply  of  decorative  green  season¬ 
ing  winter  and  summer. 

Culture.  In  the  garden,  chives  may 
be  used  as  a  border  or  for  intercropping 
between  other  vegetables  which  do  not 
produce  too  much  shade.  Since  the  chive 


A  few  pots  of  chives  or  parsley  convenient  to 
your  kitchen 


is  a  perennial  and  hardy,  the  root  clump 
need  only  be  divided  and  replanted,  or  if 
it  is  desired  to  pot  them  and  grow  them  in¬ 
doors,  the  kitchen  window  will  provide 
the  needed  sunlight,  and  frequent  water¬ 
ing  will  produce  an  abundant  growth  of 
the  slender  hollow  leaves.  Some  success 
is  also  reported  in  growing  them  in 
nutrient  solutions. 

Collards  * 

Although  collards,  or  leafy  cabbage,  are 
grown  mostly  in  the  South  for  a  depend¬ 
able  supply  of  cabbage  during  hot  weather, 
there  is  no  reason  in  the  world  why  this 
open-leaf  type  of  kale  should  not  be 
grown  in  the  North,  unless  it  be  that  we 
prefer  our  cabbage  in  solid  heads  at  the 
expense  of  a  higher  vitamin  A  content. 
Collards  are  resistant  to  cold  as  well  as 
to  heat,  and  the  plants  are  set  about  the 
same  distance  apart  in  the  garden  as  cab¬ 
bage  and  require  no  different  cultural 
treatment.  Collards  may  be  tenderized  by 
tieing  the  outer  leaves,  or  the  leaves  may 
be  plucked  for  use  at  any  time  before 
maturity.

From  stalk  to  pot 


Sweet  Corn  ^ 

Sweet  corn  has  always  been  a  favorite, 
but  now  there  is  an  added  zest  in  grow¬ 
ing  your  own  "roasting  ears,"  even  if 
you  do  not  roast  them.  This  greater 
value  of  sweet  corn  has  been  brought 
about  in  the  new  hybrid  varieties  that 
are  more  dependable  and  uniform  in 
time  of  ripening — a  boon  for  home  gar¬ 
deners  as  well  as  canners  and  market  gar¬ 
deners. 

Culture .  The  seed  should  not  be 
sown  more  than  a  week  before  the  average 
date  of  the  last  killing  frost.  Seed  should 
first  be  treated  for  disease  prevention  with 
organic  mercury  dust  (or  Semesan  Jr.); 
other  seed  treatments,  including  copper 
dusts  and  tar,  are  sometimes  advisable. 
If  planted  in  hills,  these  should  prefer¬ 
ably  be  three  feet  apart  and  certainly  not 
closer  than  two  and  one-half  feet  in  each 
direction,  six  or  seven  seeds  being 
dropped  in  each  hill,  and  later  thinned 
to  two  or  three  plants  to  the  hill.  If 
planted  in  rows,  the  early  garden  varie¬ 
ties  may  stand  ten  or  twelve  inches  apart 


in  rows  three  feet  apart.  Regardless  of 
which  method  of  planting  you  choose, 
plant  your  sweet  corn  in  a  square  or  ob¬ 
long  block  that  is  at  least  four  rows  wide. 
Otherwise  cross-pollination,  needed  for 
full  development  of  ears,  cannot  be  de¬ 
pended  upon. 

Many  home  gardeners  fail  with  their 
sweet  corn  because  they  plant  only  single 
or  double  rows  in  the  garden.  Succession 
plantings  every  ten  days,  and  a  choice  of 
early,  mid-season  and  late  varieties,  can 
provide  you  with  sweet  corn  plucked  and 
served  to  you  "within  the  hour,"  thereby 
preserving  the  sweetness  and  flavor  that  is 
denied  folks  who  do  not  have  their  own 
garden.  Sweet  corn  should  be  well  hoed, 
but  cultivation  should  never  be  so  deep 
as  to  cause  injury  to  the  roots. 

Fertilizer .  Fertilizer  for  sweet  corn 
is  best  applied  in  four-inch  bands  on 
either  side  of  hill  or  row.  At  least  ten 
pounds  of  5-8-7  per  one  hundred  foot 
row  should  be  used  on  sandy  loam  soil, 
but  perhaps  half  this  amount  would  an¬ 
swer  on  heavier  loams  and  clays.  A  light 
side  dressing  of  nitrate  of  soda  or  sul¬ 
phate  of  ammonia  (about  two  pounds 
per  one  hundred  feet  of  row)  a  week 
before  tasseling  time  should  improve  the 
succulence  of  the  corn. 

Varieties .  If  hybrid  seed  is  not  avail¬ 
able,  there  are  still  excellent  strains  of 
Golden  Bantam,  Bantam  Evergreen,  and 
Improved  Golden  Bantam  in  sweet,  yel¬ 
low-fleshed  varieties.  For  those  who  like 
good  white  sweet  corn,  Country  Gentle¬ 
man  or  Shoepeg,  Clark’s  Early  Evergreen, 
and  Stowell’s  Evergreen  are  varieties  of 
real  sweet  corn,  especially  for  mid¬ 
continent  or  northern  gardens.  In  the 
South,  Early  Golden  Sweet  and  Golden 
Early  Market  are  well-adapted  varieties

of  yellow  corn,  and  Moss  Heart  Sugar 
and  U.S.D.A.  No.  34  are  good  disease- 
and  insect-resistant  varieties  of  white 
corn. 

Hybrid  seed  corn  costs  more  to  pro¬ 
duce,  but  it  is  worth  the  extra  money  it 
costs  for  a  few  ounces  of  seed.  Golden 
Cross,  Hiawatha,  or  Ioana  are  all  fine 
golden  or  yellow  varieties.  Country  Gen¬ 
tleman  Top  Cross  or  Illinois  Country 
Gentleman  Hybrid  are  representative  of 
prolific  varieties  of  the  larger  eared  sorts 
of  white  corn. 

Diseases.  Although  a  small  garden 
may  escape  some  of  the  insects  and  dis¬ 
eases  that  affect  sweet  corn,  preparedness 
to  meet  the  attacks  of  cutworms  by  means 
of  poisoned  bran  bait,  and  to  prevent  in¬ 
jury  by  the  corn-ear  worm  by  dusting 
with  a  mixture  of  calcium  arsenate  and 
either  mineral  oil  or  flours  of  sulphur,  will 
be  insurance  well  worth  having.  Although 
corn  borers  are  not  often  active  in  home 
gardens,  it  is  well  to  be  on  the  safe  side 
by  removing  and  burning  cornstalks  and 
their  roots  in  an  early  fall  clean-up  opera¬ 
tion.  Progressive  gardeners  also  plant 
only  seed  that  has  been  treated  with  cop¬ 
per  dust  for  smut  infection  and  often  dip 
in  a  tar  solution  to  prevent  sabotage  by 
crows  and  chickens  before  the  seed  ger¬ 
minates. 

Cucumber 

Provision  for  a  few  hills  of  cucumbers 
in  a  medium-sized  garden,  or  as  many  as 
twenty  hills  if  you  have  the  space  and 
want  to  put  up  pickles,  will  usually  an¬ 
swer  a  family’s  requirements.  Although 
it  is  a  cool  growing  season  crop,  you  will 
do  better  by  deferring  its  planting  until 
the  latter  half  of  May  or  early  June. 
Planting  dates  may  be  advanced  in  the 


South,  cucumbers  being  grown  either  as  an 
early  spring  or  fall  crop.  For  a  succession, 
plant  at  ten-day  intervals  until  July  1st. 

Culture.  Most  varieties  should  be 
planted  in  hills  not  less  than  five  feet 
apart;  and  usually  six  or  seven  feet  is  bet¬ 
ter.  Eight  or  ten  seeds  to  the  hill,  thinned 
at  first  to  three  and  then  not  more  than 
two  good  strong  plants,  is  probably  the 
best  practice.  The  use  of  a  shovelful  of 
well-rotted  manure,  thoroughly  mixed 
with  the  soil,  and  supplemented  with  a 
small  teacupful  of  5-8-7  fertilizer,  should 
push  the  plants  ahead  of  the  weeds,  if  only 
cucumber  beetles  are  not  lying  in  wait  to 
slay  the  young  seedlings.  Your  pre¬ 


paredness  with  a  1  to  20  mixture  of  cal¬ 
cium  arsenate  and  lime  (or  gypsum), 
applied  with  a  hand  duster  or  perforated 
tin  can  or  a  coarse  burlap  bag,  may  win 
the  battle.  Invasions  by  either  the  striped 
cucumber  beetle  or  twelve-spotted  cucum¬ 
ber  beetle  may  best  be  controlled  later 
on  with  rotenone  dust  or  pyrethrum  dust 
and  spray.  Nicotine  dusts  or  sprays  will 
control  the  melon  aphis,  which  may  attack 
during  the  bearing  season. 

Varieties .  A  selection  of  varieties  for 
home  use  should  perhaps  include  both 
slicing  and  pickling  types.  Of  the  former, 
improved  varieties  of  the  White  Spine 
types,  such  as  Kirby,  Longfellow,  Long 


GARDENS  WILL  HELP,  TOD.  WEED  'EM  AND  REAP  FOR  VICTORY 


FIFTY-ONE  VEGETABLES  *

Green,  and  the  All-America  selection, 
Straight  Eight,  might  well  lead  the  list; 
and  for  pickles,  improved  Black  Spine 
varieties,  such  as  Chicago,  Boston  or  Jer¬ 
sey  Pickling,  National  Pickle,  are  all  pro¬ 
ductive  and  satisfactory. 


Egg  Plant  * 

A  few  egg  plants  will  add  variety  to 
the  small  garden  and  this  rather  long- 
season  sister  of  the  potato  and  the  to¬ 
mato  may  be  set  out  when  all  danger  of 
frost  is  over.  The  preference  today  is 
more  for  the  smaller  compact  fruits,  and 
egg  plant  should  always  be  used  before 
the  seeds  harden  and  the  flesh  becomes 
tough.  They  may  be  spaced  at  24  inches 
in  rows  about  thirty  inches  apart.  A  small 
handful  of  5-8-7  fertilizer  in  the  hill,  or 
ten  pounds  per  100  feet  mixed  thor¬ 
oughly  with  the  soil  in  the  row,  should 
provide  their  need  for  steady  uninter¬ 
rupted  growth.  If  egg  plant  is  raised  from 
seed,  the  usual  corrosive  sublimate  treat¬ 
ment,  plus  a  cuprous  oxide  or  Semesan 
dusting,  will  provide  the  best  insurance 
against  Phomopsis  blight,  bacterial  and 
verticilium  wilt.  A  weekly  bordeaux 
spray  will  ward  off  infection  during  the 
growing  season. 

Varieties.  Garden  varieties  may  well 
be  copies  of  commercial  strains.  Black 
Beauty  is  earlier  than  some,  although 
some  of  the  newer  varieties,  including 
Bountiful  and  Blackie,  and  especially  the 
New  Hampshire  Hybrid,  are  prolific  and 
profitable  home  garden  sorts.  Cultivation 
should  be  directed  towards  weed  elimina¬ 
tion,  and  care  should  be  taken  to  avoid 
injury  to  the  root  system. 


Endive  * 

The  name  Endive  is  used  rather  loose¬ 
ly,  but  it  really  belongs  to  all  of  the 
varieties  of  annual  chicory.  It  includes 
the  broad  leaved  sorts,  like  Escarole,  or 
Fullheart  and  Batavian  Endive,  which 
are  often  used  unblanched  in,  soups  and 
stews.  The  narrow  leaved  sorts  have 
curled  or  fringed  leaves  and  are  repre¬ 
sented  by  such  varieties  as  Green  Curled 
and  White  Curled. 

Culture  is  similar  for  all  varieties. 
Good,  rich,  moist  soil  endowed  with 
plenty  of  plant  food  is  necessary  for  ten¬ 
der,  succulent  leaves;  and  the  same  fer¬ 
tilizer  treatment  indicated  for  lettuce  will 
favor  its  rapid  growth.  Plants  are  usually 
thinned  to  six  or  eight  inches  in  the 
rows,  which  may  be  sixteen  or  eighteen 
inches  apart.  Blanching  may  requite  from 
two  to  three  weeks  or  longer  in  cooler 
weather.  The  leaves  should  be  dry  be¬ 
fore  they  are  tied  for  blanching.  In  the 
home  garden,  rubber  bands  snapped  over 
the  enveloping  outer  leaves  will  provide 
a  supply  of  this  delicious  but  slightly  bit¬ 
ter  salad,  which  may  be  enjoyed  from 
late  spring  until  early  winter. 

Garlic 

This  member  of  the  onion  family  be¬ 
longs  to  a  distinct  species  that  produces 
compound  bulbs  of  eight  or  ten  bulblets 
or  cloves  in  a  compact  overbulb  and  is 
propagated  by  planting  these  little  bulb- 
lets  in  either  spring  or  fall  in  any  warm 
or  mild  climate. 


46  M  *  M 


HOW  TO  GROW  A  VICTORY  GARDEN 


Culture .  Garlic  thrives  especially  in 
fertile  well-drained  sandy  loam  soils.  The 
bulblets  are  set  four  to  six  inches  apart, 
and  the  rows  may  be  a  foot  apart.  After 
the  tops  die  down  in  the  fall,  the  bulbs 
are  lifted  from  the  ground  and  cured, 
usually  by  weaving  them  with  their  tops 
into  braids.  The  limited  need  for  garlic 
may  not  justify  the  home  gardener  in 
planting  it;  however,  a  few  cloves  can  be 
set  out  along  with  other  onions. 

Kale  * 

The  increasing  popularity  of  kale  in 
northern  markets  suggests  that  the  home 
gardener  will  not  only  have  use  for  this 
member  of  the  cabbage  family  as  a  pot 
herb  or  for  spring  greens,  but  will  plant 
it  in  succession  for  a  spring,  summer,  and 
fall  supply. 

In  northern  gardens,  seeds  may  be 
sown  early  in  April  or  May  and  until 
July  for  plants  that  will  develop  before 
frost.  Culture  otherwise  is  similar  to  that 
for  cabbage,  excepting  that  plants  may 
be  only  eight  to  ten  inches  apart  in 


rows  two  feet  apart.  The  same  favorable 
conditions,  of  soil,  fertilization  and  in¬ 
sect  control,  apply  to  kale  as  indicated 
under  cabbage  and  other  cole  crops.  Kale 
can  be  harvested  either  by  plucking  the 
outer  leaves  when  young  or  by  pulling 
the  entire  plant  at  any  time.  Few  vege¬ 
tables  are  better  adapted  or  more  depend¬ 
able  for  "greens,”  in  spring,  summer,  and 
fall,  than  kale.  Dwarf  Blue  Scotch  is  the 
most  popular  variety,  and  Dwarf  Green 
is  usually  preferred  to  Dwarf  Siberian. 

Kohlrabi  * 

Kohlrabi,  or  turnip-rooted  cabbage, 
will  produce  a.  very  satisfactory  crop  from 
seed  sown  as  soon  as  the  ground  can 
properly  be  fitted.  It  is  a  very  hardy 
crop,  which  may  be  grown  early  from 
plants  set  in  the  ground  in  April  or  May. 
The  turnip-like  bulb,  which  is  produced 
above  the  ground,  should  be  eaten  before 
it  becomes  woody  and  tough;  and  a  suc¬ 
cession  may  be  had  throughout  the  sum¬ 
mer,  or  a  late  crop  produced  for  storage, 
if  planted  in  July  or,  in  warmer  regions, 
even  in  August.  White  Vienna  is  the 
leading  variety,  and  a  heavy  crop  can  be 
grown  either  in  double  rows  two  feet 
apart  or  in  single  rows  fifteen  inches 
apart.  Plants  should  be  thinned  six  or 
eight  inches  in  the  row.  Treatment  with 
manure  and  fertilizer  is  similar  to  that  for 
cabbage. 

Leek  * 

For  those  who  prefer  milder  onions, 
the  leek  deserves  consideration.  The  home 
gardener  will  find  its  culture  not  at  all 
difficult,  since  uniform  stands  from  early 
seedings  result  in  luxuriant  growth,  espe¬ 
cially  in  rich  soils  reinforced  with  fertil¬ 
izer  as  suggested  under  "Onions.” 


Kohlrabi  at  its  best  in  a  community  garden 


******  47 


Culture .  The  production  of  tender 
sheaves  of  leaves  which  constitute  the 
edible  stalk  is  accomplished  by  either 
hilling  or  setting  the  seedlings  in  trenches 
three  or  four  inches  deep  and  gradually 
filling  them  with  soil  as  the  plants  de¬ 
velop.  Leeks  are  seeded  in  rows  twelve 
to  sixteen  inches  apart  and  thinned  to  two 
or  three  inches  in  the  row.  They  may  be 
stored  for  winter  use  in  outdoor  trenches, 
or  in  sand  in  cool  cellars. 

Lettuce  *  * 

You  may  have  a  supply  of  green  let¬ 
tuce  from  early  spring  to  fall,  but  only  if 
expert  care  and  attention  are  provided 
during  the  hot  summer  months.  Most 
home  gardeners  rightly  prefer  to  grow  a 
liberal  supply  of  leafy  lettuce  and  early 
heading  sorts  in  the  spring,  depending 
on  other  salad  crops  during  the  heat  of 
summer,  and  then  content  themselves 
with  some  Big  Boston  or  other  loose-leaf 
heading  type  for  the  late  summer  and 
fall. 


first  mess  of  lettuce  may  be  had  from  the 
thinnings.  Later,  harvests  of  leaf  lettuce 
may  be  cut  off  with  shears  just  above  the 
ground  and  a  second  crop,  though  not 
quite  so  tender,  will  spring  up.  Grand 
Rapids  and  Blackseeded  Simpson  are 
about  the  best  and  most  common  varie¬ 
ties. 

Head  lettuce  for  the  early  crop  is  grown 
from  seed  sown  about  four  weeks  prior 
to  transplanting  in  the  open  ground.  The 
use  of  both  hotbeds  and  cold  frames 
permits  the  hardening  of  plants  and 
assures  better  growth  when  ordinary  trans¬ 
planting  precautions  are  observed.  Im¬ 
proved  Hanson  and  Crisp  As  Ice  are 
good  crisp-head  types.  Butter  Head  types, 
such  as  White  Boston,  Tender  Heart,  and 
May  King,  are  very  satisfactory  for  the 
home  garden — although,  for  later  plant¬ 
ing,  Salamander,  All  Season,  and  Black 
Seeded  Tennis  Ball  are  considered  more 
dependable  "headers”  during  the  warmer 
weather.  Difficulties  in  growing  crisp- 
head  types  are  likely  to  be  overcome  only 
under  the  most  favorable  climatic  condi¬ 
tions.  New  York  No.  515  and  No.  12 
are  improved  strains  of  the  Iceberg  or 
crisp-head  lettuce.  Head  lettuce  is  usually 
set  about  ten  inches  apart  in  the  rows, 
which  are  twelve  to  eighteen  inches  apart. 
Cos  lettuce  or  Romaine,  distinguished  by 
longer  heads  bearing  long  crisp  leaves, 
is  usually  more  satisfactory  for  the  home 
garden  than  the  crisp-head  sorts,  and 
either  White  Paris  or  Trianon  should  fill 
the  bill. 


Culture.  Loose  or  green-leaf  lettuce 
may  be  sown  almost  everywhere  two 
weeks  before  the  last  killing  frost.  Seed 
is  sown  continuously  in  rows  eight  or 
nine  inches  apart;  and  the  lettuce,  when 
about  two  inches  tall,  is  thinned  to 
about  2]/2  inches  apart  in  the  row.  The

Types  of  Soil.  Although  lettuce  may 
be  grown  on  many  different  types  of 
soil,  the  warmer,  sandy  loams  are  pref¬ 
erable  for  the  early  crop;  and  the  looser 
silt  and  clay  loams  well  supplied  with 
organic  matter  are  more  dependable  for 
the  summer  and  fall  crop.  Muck  or 
peat  soils,  which  are  most  generally  used 
for  the  commercial  crop,  are  of  course 
ideal  if  available  to  the  home  gardener. 
Since  rapid,  continuous  growth  is  essen¬ 
tial,  well-manured  soils  should  be  supple¬ 
mented  by  the  use  of  complete  fertilizer 
used  broadcast  and  disked  in  at  the  rate 
of  three  or  four  pounds  per  100  square 
feet.  The  use  of  side  dressings  with 
nitrate  of  soda  at  the  rate  of  y2  pound  per 
100  square  feet,  just  before  the  plants 
start  to  head,  is  a  good  practice  only  when 
applied  just  before  a  rain  or  previous  to 
irrigation.  Soils  should  be  neither  too 
sweet  nor  too  sour,  and  lime  should  be  ap¬ 
plied  with  caution. 

Although  lettuce  may  be  grown  year 
after  year  without  loss  from  insects  or 
diseases,  there  are  times  when  cutworms, 
lice,  and  cabbage  loopers  do  some  dam¬ 
age.  They  should  be  controlled  with  poi¬ 
son  bran  mash,  nicotine,  pyrethrum,  and 
rotenone.  Tip  burn  is  a  physiological  dis¬ 
ease,  but  usually  not  serious  on  the  early 
and  late  crops.  If  either  yellotvs  or  mosaic 
disease  appears,  this  is  just  a  warning  to 
remove  diseased  plants,  destroy  all  refuse, 
and  use  disease-free  seed  the  next  year. 

Mustard  Greens  * 

Mustard  greens  or  mustard  spinach  is 
an  acceptable  substitute  for  spinach  and 
can  usually  be  depended  upon  for  satis¬ 
factory  growth,  even  in  poor  soil.  Al¬ 
though  the  seed  of  ordinary  black  mustard 
is  often  planted,  the  Chinese  or  Japanese 
varieties  have  the  advantage  either  of 


curled  leaves  or  more  abundant  foliage. 

Culture.  The  seed  should  be  sown  as 
early  in  the  spring  as  possible  in  the 
North  or,  if  wanted  for  a  fall  crop,  in 
late  July  or  early  August.  In  the  South 
the  crops  are  often  started  in  the  fall  for 
early  spring  salad.  Seed  is  sown  in  drills 
about  twelve  inches  apart,  and  the  plants 
thinned  to  five  or  six  inches  in  the  row. 
Fordhook  Fancy  and  Southern  Giant 
Curled  or  the  new  Tendergreen  variety 
otherwise  known  as  Spinach  Mustard 
should  have  an  especial  appeal  for  the 
home  gardener  who  has  a  fondness  for 

«  <  9  9 

greens. 

Okra 

Although  a  warm  season  crop,  okra 
(or  gumbo)  can  be  grown  in  the  North 
on  good  warm  fertile  soils.  Heavy  appli¬ 
cations  of  manure  and  fertilizer  favor  the 
rapid  development  essential  for  the  pro¬ 
duction  of  tender  pods.  The  seeds  may 
be  sown  in  hills  or  drills  in  rows  about 
3 ]/2  feet  apart  for  the  dwarf  varieties 
and  four  feet  apart  for  the  tall  ones.  If 
grown  in  hills,  the  plants  may  be  thinned 
to  eighteen  or  twenty  inches  in  the  row, 
but  not  more  than  three  plants  should  be 
left  when  they  are  planted  in  hills. 

While  Long  Green  and  White  Velvet 
are  popular  tall  varieties,  the  Dwarf  Pro¬ 
lific,  with  smaller  pods,  is  very  productive. 
Improved  strains  with  spineless  pods  have 
recently  been  introduced,  and  of  these  the 
Clemson  Spineless  is  an  excellent  strain 
of  the  long-podded  type.  Another  good 
dwarf  variety  is  the  New  Orleans  Mar¬ 
ket,  which  bears  dark  green  round  and 
short  pods.  White  Lightning — with  long, 
tapering,  spineless  pods — is  probably  the 
most  recent  introduction.

Onion  *  * 


Of  the  several  types  of  onions  grown 
in  North  America,  the  home  gardener’s 
interest  is  practically  confined  to  one 
species  (Allium  Cepa)  from  which  to 
make  his  selection  of  the  best  onions 
to  grow,  either  for  "scallions”  or  for 
mature  onions.  For  those  who  are  inter¬ 
ested  in  growing  other  onion  species, 
more  specific  information  is  given  under 
"Chives,”  "Leeks,”  and  "Shallots.”  You 
must  also  decide  whether  to  grow  your 
onions  from  seeds  or  .sets.  For  the  small 
gardener,  the  safest  and  surest  bet  is  on 
sets  for  scallions  in  early  spring,  for  cook¬ 
ing  onions  throughout  the  summer,  and 
for  winter  storage.  Flowever,  since  onions 
grown  from  seed  are  sweeter  and  will 
keep  better,  many  gardeners  who  have 
rich,  loamy  soils,  with  plenty  of  available 
moisture,  successfully  grow  onions  from 
seed,  or  from  seedling  plants  which  are 
now  available  in  many  markets. 

Onions  from  Sets .  You  have  your 
choice  of  white,  yellow,  and  red  varieties 
of  onion  sets;  and  these  small  onions 
grown  from  seed,  properly  stored,  free 
of  disease,  should  be  firm  and  average 
about  y2  inch  in  diameter.  As  early  as 
the  ground  can  be  worked  in  the  spring, 
set  them  about  two  inches  apart  in  the 
row  and  take  your  choice  of  single  rows, 


twelve  to  fourteen  inches  apart;  or  double 
rows  two  feet  apart,  with  a  space  of  about 
six  inches  between  the  plants  of  the  dou¬ 
ble  row.  Perennial  onion  sets  are  also  ob¬ 
tainable,  and  these  may  either  be  planted 
in  the  perennial  bed  on  one  side  of  the 
garden  or  set  in  garden  rows  for  extra- 
early  scallions.  Of  these,  there  are  two 
types,  one  of  which  is  usually  referred  to 
as  Multiplier  or  Potato  onion  because  of 
its  dividing  bulbs,  and  the  other  as  the 
Top-Tree  or  Egyptian,  which  never  forms 
an  enlarged  bulb  in  the  ground,  but  bears 
bulblets  in  the  top  instead  of  flowers.  The 
White  Multiplier  is  probably  the  milder 
and  better  scallion  onion  for  the  amateur. 

Onions  from  Seed.  Whether  grown 
from  seeds  or  sets,  a  rich  moisture-filled 
soil  is  essential  to  success  with  onions. 
Seedling  plants  of  the  Spanish  and  Ber¬ 
muda  types,  shipped  from  the  South,  now 
make  it  possible  to  grow  these  large  mild- 
flavored  bulbs  even  in  the  northern  states. 
Set  them  two  or  three  inches  apart  in 
the  row  with  the  rows  fourteen  or  six¬ 
teen  inches  apart,  or,  if  you  prefer,  use 
the  double  row  system.  Should  you 
attempt  growing  onions  from  seed,  thin 
plants  to  six  or  nine  to  the  foot.  Thor¬ 
ough  preparation  of  the  seed  bed  should 
be  preceded  by  a  broadcast  application 
of  high-grade  5-8-7  fertilizer  at  the  rate 
of  1500  pounds  per  acre,  or  three  pounds 
well  mixed  with  the  soil  in  one  hundred 
feet  of  row. 

Varieties.  Your  personal  preference 
between  yellow,  white,  and  red  varieties 
will  be  granted  to  you  in  a  selection  of 
either  Yellow  Globe  Danvers,  Southport 
Yellow  Globe,  Ohio  or  Michigan  Yellow 
Globe,  White  Portugal,  Southport  White 
Globe,  or  Red  Wethersfield.  More  expe¬ 
rienced  gardeners  sometimes  attempt

to  grow  European  varieties.  Of  these, 
Prize  Taker  probably  offers  less  grief 
to  the  northern  amateur,  although  the 
southern  home  gardener  has  his  choice 
of  all  the  best  commercial  strains.  Sweet 
Spanish  or  Valencia  Yellow  Bermuda,  as 
well  as  the  improved  Creole,  are  often 
available  as  seedlings  shipped  from  the 
South  and  usually  may  be  safely  trans¬ 
planted  during  April.  Small  onions  for 
pickling  are  grown  by  sowing  the  seed 
generously  in  open  ground  as  late  as  the 
middle  of  June  and  thinning  to  only  about 
an  inch  apart  in  the  row.  White  Portugal, 
Brown  Australia  and  Ebenezer  are  good 
pickling  varieties. 

Other  Onion  Species .  Another  dis¬ 
tinct  species  of  onion  worth  the  home 
gardener’s  attention  is  the  White  Welsh, 
otherwise  described  as  White  or  Hardy 
Bunching  Onion,  a  perennial  with  no  dis¬ 
tinct  bulb.  He  Shi  Ko  is  an  improved 
Japanese  variety.  Red  varieties  of  onions 
are  best  for  winter  storage,  and  white 
onions  are  considered  the  "poorest 
keepers." 

Although  onions  in  the  home  garden 
may  often  escape  attacks  of  the  onion 
maggot  or  thrips,  these  insects  may  be 
held  in  check  with  bichloride  of  mercury 
treatments  and  nicotine  sprays  respective¬ 
ly.  Onion  smut  may  also  be  checked  with 
formaldehyde  soil  treatments. 

Parsley  * 

There  is  little  excuse  on  the  part  of 
the  home  gardener  for  not  having  a 
short  row  of  parsley,  since  it  will  thrive 
in  any  good  soil.  Although  parsley  seeds 
are  small  and  germinate  very  slowly  (un¬ 
less  soaked  in  water  over  night  before 
planting),  it  is  not  difficult  to  obtain  a 
stand  of  plants.  Parsley  will  thrive  under 


soil  and  temperature  conditions  favorable 
to  lettuce  or  spinach. 

Culture.  Sometimes  a  board  is  laid 
over  the  row  for  a  few  days  until  the 
seedlings  are  ready  to  emerge  from  the 
soil.  A  plentiful  supply  of  water  is  essen¬ 
tial  for  germination.  The  row  of  parsley 
should  be  kept  about  sixteen  inches  away 
from  other  plants  and  not  shaded  by  tall 
growing  vegetables.  Plants  are  usually 
thinned  to  five  or  six  inches  in  the  row. 
For  extra-early  parsley,  the  seed  should, 
of  course,  be  sown  indoors  and  trans¬ 
planted  as  early  as  possible.  Planted  in 
a  succession  every  three  or  four  weeks 
until  July,  it  is  possible  to  provide  the 
young  tender  leaves  for  garnishes  and 
flavoring  throughout  the  growing  season, 
and,  if  a  cold  frame  is  available,  trans¬ 
planted  plants  may  provide  a  winter  and 
very  early  spring  supply.  Parsley  is  sel¬ 
dom  the  victim  of  insect  attacks  or  plant 
diseases. 

Turnip-Rooted  Parsley.  Hamburg 
or  turnip-rooted  parsley  has  been  de¬ 
veloped  for  its  fleshy  root,  the  flavor  of 
which  resembles  that  of  the  leafy  varie¬ 
ties  and  is  useful  especially  in  stews  or 
other  mixtures  of  vegetables.  Culture  is 
also  similar,  except  that  the  plants  are 
usually  thinned  to  three  or  four  inches 
apart  in  the  row.  Turnip-rooted  parsley 
may  remain  in  the  ground  until  frost 
and  may  be  stored  like  other  root  crops 
for  the  winter  larder.

Parsnip  * 

Unlike  their  near  relatives,  parsley, 
carrots  and  celery,  parsnips  should  be 
grown  to  full  maturity  in  order  to  cap¬ 
ture  all  of  the  sweetness  and  flavor  pecu¬ 
liar  to  this  old-time  vegetable.  In  com-

Not  “two  peas  in  a  pod’  but  sextuplets 

mon  with  other  root  crops,  rich  and  fertile 
loamy  soils  favor  the  development  of 
straight  and  smooth,  creamy  white  roots. 
Fresh  seed  should  always  be  planted,  and, 
as  with  carrots,  radishes  may  be  sown 
with  them  to  mark  the  rows.  Covered 
with  about  %  inch  of  soil,  the  delicate 
seedlings  must  be  nurtured  along  and 
the  plants  must  be  thinned  three  or  four 
inches  in  the  rows,  which  are  usually 
about  eighteen  inches  apart.  Parsnips 
may  be  left  in  the  ground  until  after 
freezing  weather  and  removed  any  time 
when  digging  will  permit.  In  fact,  freez¬ 
ing  improves  the  sweetness  and  flavor.  If 
your  garden  space  permits  growing  roots 
for  winter  storage,  you  may  be  converted 
to  the  parsnip  when  you  grow  your  own. 
Hollow  Crown,  Model,  and  Ideal  are 
the  most  popular  varieties.  Parsnips  are 
relatively  free  from  insect  attacks  or  other 
plant  diseases.  The  parsnip  webworm 
may  occasionally  destroy  some  leaves,  but 
it  can  be  controlled  by  the  use  of  arsen¬ 
ical  sprays. 


Peas  * 

Fortunately  this  quick-growing  cool 
weather  crop — peas — can  be  planted  early 
enough  so  that  the  home  gardener  can, 
by  growing  two  or  three  varieties,  delight 
his  family  with  a  succession  of  peas  for 
several  weeks  before  hot  weather  sets  in. 
The  earliest  varieties  require  about  fifty 
days  from  seeding  time  to  harvest.  Better 
success  is  usually  obtained  by  planting  two 
o:  three  different  varieties  rather  than  by 
depending  upon  a  succession  of  planting 
dates  of  the  same  variety.  Since  home¬ 
grown  peas  are  a  treat  second  only  to 
home-grown  sweet  corn,  it  is  smart  to 
avoid  those  market  garden  types  that  lack 
sweetness  and  delicate  flavor.  For  the 
most  part,  the  early  wrinkled  types  carry 
these  "extra”  qualities  to  a  greater  extent 
than  later  smooth-seeded  varieties. 

Culture .  Moist  and  well-drained  soils 
enriched  with  commercial  plant  food,  pro¬ 
duce  excellent  crops,  although  the  lighter 
sandy  loams  are  better  adapted  for  grow¬ 
ing  the  earliest  varieties.  Peas  are  usually 
one  of  the  first  crops  to  be  planted  early 
in  April  and  a  pint  of  seed  will  plant 
about  thirty  feet  of  row.  Plant  to  a  depth 
ot  four  or  five  inches  in  lighter  soils  and 
about  three  inches  in  heavier  types.  If 
peas  are  planted  to  a  greater  depth,  it  is 
best  to  cover  them  with  about  two  inches 
of  soil  and  gradually  fill  in  ahead  of  ger¬ 
mination.  The  earlier  dwarf  varieties  can 
be  grown  in  double  rows,  but  better  suc¬ 
cess  is  obtained  with  medium  and  tall 
varieties  by  planting  in  single  rows  at 
least  two  feet  apart  to  permit  placing 
brush  or  sticks  or  trellises  for  stronger 
upright  growth. 

Varieties .  Early  varieties  of  wrinkled 
seeded  peas  are  probably  the  sweetest,  but

as  a  rule  do  not  compare  in  yields  with 
the  later  sorts.  Improved  Gradus,  Thomas 
Laxton,  Laxton’s  Progress,  American 
Wonder  are  all  among  the  earliest  of  these 
sugary  wrinkled  varieties.  Little  Marvel 
and  Century  of  Progress  may  be  planted 
for  ten-day-later  ripening.  If  you  prefer 
the  smooth-seeded  sorts,  Alaska,  Bounti¬ 
ful,  and  Mammoth  Podded  Early  are  good 
prolific  types  recommended  to  home  gar¬ 
deners.  For  later  peas  you  may  select 
varieties  of  the  telephone  type,  with  vines 
varying  in  height  from  twenty  inches  to 
five  feet.  Alderman,  Mid-Season  Giant, 
and  Stratagem  or  Potlach  are  good  vari¬ 
eties  resistant  to  fusarium  wilt  and  also 
very  productive  if  grown  with  brush  or 
trellis  support.  If  you  have  never  tasted 
edible  podded  peas,  try  Dwarf  Gray  or 
Dwarf  White  Sugar,  or  Mammoth  Melt¬ 
ing  Sugar,  but  eat  them  when  young  and 
tender. 

Pea  Pests .  The  most  serious  pest  of 
the  pea  is  probably  the  pea  aphis,  which 
in  summer  seasons  may  ruin  the  crop. 
Drastic  measures  must  be  taken  as  soon  as 
these  pea-green  lice  appear  on  the  foliage. 
A  four  per  cent  nicotine  dust  or  a  four 
per  cent  derris  rotenone  contact  spray 
of  sufficient  strength  to  kill  at  the  first 
application  must  be  used.  Should  your  pea 
vines  become  "alive  with  lice,’’  use  more 
rather  than  less  to  the  row  than  the  usual 
instructions  call  for.  Pea  seed  is  usually 
treated  with  carbon  bisulphide  to  control 
the  pea  weevil,  and  disease-resistant  vari¬ 
eties  may  be  selected  to  combat  fusarium 
wilt.  These  seed  treatments  should  also 
include  the  usual  copper  or  zinc  oxide  or 
Semesan  applications  recommended  in  our 
discussion  of  Seed  Treatments  and  Dis¬ 
ease  Prevention.  Spraying  and  dusting 
will  also  help  to  control  the  virus  mosaic 
disease,  which  is  spread  by  the  aphids. 


Crow  them  sweet  or  grow  them  hot 


Peppers  * 

A  few  pepper  plants,  set  in  the  garden 
when  all  danger  of  frost  is  over,  can  usu¬ 
ally  be  relied  upon  for  a  supply  of  sweet 
peppers  from  July  until  frost;  and  the 
pungent-fruited  varieties,  for  a  winter  sup¬ 
ply.  Your  choice  of  varieties  and  types 
of  the  mild  or  sweet  fruits,  often  called 
"mangos,"  can  be  narrowed  down  to  the 
types  which  suit  both  your  taste  and  the 
uses  you  may  want  to  make  of  peppers. 
Early  and  late  varieties  of  both  "sweet" 
and  "hot"  peppers  are  available. 

Culture.  Pepper  plants  grown  from 
seed  planted  indoors  about  eight  weeks 
before  setting  in  the  garden  should  be 
strong  and  vigorous.  A  high  temperature 
is  favorable  both  to  germination  and  the 
rapid  growth  essential  for  vigor.  A  warm, 
moist,  fertile,  sandy  loam  soil  will  also 
favor  their  later  growth  in  the  open 
ground.  Plants  may  be  set  from  June  until 
August  according  to  variety  and  climatic 
zone.  The  width  of  the  rows  may  range 
from  eighteen  inches  to  three  feet,  and 
they  may  be  set  from  twelve  to  twenty- 
four  inches  apart  according  to  their  habits 
of  growth. 

Varieties.  Of  the  mild-fruited  sorts, 
Ruby  King  is  a  general  favorite,  although 
King  of  the  North,  Worldbeater,  and  the 
Harris  Early  Giant  are  increasingly  popu¬ 
lar.  The  latter  is  an  excellent  early  variety 
of  the  "bull-nosed"  type.  The  California 
Wonder  is  a  later  variety  producing  hand¬ 
some,  chunky  peppers,  and  vies  with  the 
earlier  Waltham  Beauty  or  Windsor  A  for

thickness  of  wall  and  sweetness  of  flavor. 
When  it  comes  to  the  pungent  fruited 
sorts,  Tobasco  is  rather  standard  for  the 
small  slender  bright  red  fruits  "with 
plenty  of  pep."  Both  Chili  and  Long  Red 
Cayenne  are  earlier,  long,  slender  types 
with  ample  pungency,  while  Hungarian 
Wax  is  an  early  yellow  hot  pepper  that 
changes  to  bright  red  when  it  is  ripe. 


pieces — cut  to  contain  one,  but  not  more 
than  two  eyes — are  dropped  at  intervals 
of  ten  or  twelve  inches  and  covered  to  a 
depth  of  three  or  four  inches.  The  ground 
should  be  raked  over  once  or  twice  before 
the  sprouts  appear;  and,  as  the  season  ad- 
vances,  slight  but  gradual  hilling,  to  pre¬ 
vent  exposure  of  tubers  to  the  sun,  should 
be  practiced. 


Potato  * 

Success  with  potatoes,  early  or  late,  de¬ 
pends  on  planting  disease-free  and,  if 
possible,  northern-grown  certified  seed 
adapted  to  local  soil  and  climate  condi¬ 
tions.  Land  should  be  well  drained  and 
the  soil  provided  with  plenty  of  humus, 
but  this  is  more  important  on  heavy  soils 
than  on  sandy  loams.  Heavy,  compact 
clays  should  be  avoided.  Do  not  plant 
table-stock  potatoes,  either  home-grown 
or  obtained  from  the  corner  grocery. 


Varieties .  For  early  potatoes,  the  Cob¬ 
bler,  Early  Ohio,  Triumph  and  Warba  are 
probably  the  most  popular  varieties.  Mid¬ 
season  varieties  succeeding  in  the  cooler 
portions  of  the  Midwest  are  Chippewa 
and  Katahdin.  Persisting  late  varieties, 
especially  in  the  eastern  states,  are  Green 
Mountain,  Norcross,  and  Gold  Coin.  For 
heavier  soils  in  sections  with  less  rainfall, 
the  Russet  varieties  such  as  Rural  Russet 
and  Late  Petoskey  are  popular,  as  are  also 
the  smooth-skinned  Rural  New  Yorker 
No.  2,  Sir  Walter  Raleigh,  and  Carman. 


Fertilizer.  Few  crops  respond  better 
to  the  use  of  fertilizer  than  the  Irish 
potato,  and  successful  growers  use  from 
1000  to  2500  pounds  per  acre  of  a  fer¬ 
tilizer  with  an  analysis  averaging  4  per 
cent  nitrogen,  8  per  cent  available  phos¬ 
phoric  acid,  and  8  to  12  per  cent  potash. 
This  is  equivalent  to  from  ten  to  twenty 
pounds  per  one  hundred  feet  of  row.  It 
is  thoroughly  mixed  with  the  soil,  or 
placed  in  two  four-inch  bands  on  either 
side,  and  slightly  below  the  level  of  the 
seed  piece. 

After  preparing  a  furrow  about  five 
inches  deep  in  a  mellow  seed  bed,  the  seed 


Diseases.  Home-grown  potatoes  rare¬ 
ly  escape  some  of  the  diseases  and  insect 
attacks  common  to  the  commercial  crop. 
The  severity  of  common  scab  and  also 
Rhizoctonia,  or  Black  Scurf,  can  be  con¬ 
trolled  by  a  1  to  120  corrosive  sublimate 
solution  or  Semesan  Bel  dip.  Both  late 
blight  and  attacks  by  the  Colorado  Potato 
Beetle  are  held  in  check  by  the  use  of 
the  standard  bordeaux-arsenical  dusts  or 
sprays.  Flea  beetles  may  be  driven  away 
by  dusting  with  hydrated  lime. 

The  best  defense  against  all  potato 
diseases  is  obtained  from  the  use  of  cer¬ 
tified  seed  and  of  rather  acid  soil,  which 
discourages  the  development  of  scab.  For 
this  reason,  gardeners  who  grow  potatoes 
may  be  more  successful  if  they  reserve  a 
potato  patch  on  which  lime  is  not  applied.

Pumpkin 

Pumpkins  are  in  reality  a  farm  crop, 
but  on  occasion  a  gardener  may  have  some 
ground  which  is  not  useful  for  intensive 
home  gardening  purposes,  or  may  find  a 
place  to  plant  two  or  three  hills  of  pump¬ 
kin,  allowing  the  vines  to  trail  upon  a  wall 
or  out  of  the  way  of  other  vegetables.  In 
this  event,  seeding  and  culture  do  not  dif¬ 
fer  from  those  of  cucumbers  or  canta¬ 
loupes,  excepting  for  the  greater  area 
needed  for  the  vines.  The  principal  vari¬ 
eties  of  "pie  pumpkins"  are  Large  Cheese, 
New  England  Pie,  Table  Queen,  Winter 
Luxury,  and  Small  Sugar.  Incidentally, 
our  bush-type  varieties  of  scallops  and 
vegetable  marrows  are  in  reality  pump¬ 
kins.  Seedsmen  usually  list  these  small 
pumpkins  under  Squashes,  but  they  are 
here  treated  separately  from  both  Pump¬ 
kins  and  Squashes  under  the  heading 
"Vegetable  Marrows  and  Scallops." 

Radish  *  * 

Suggestions  have  been  made  that  rad¬ 
ishes  be  planted  to  mark  the  rows  of  cer¬ 
tain  garden  plants  which  are  slow  or  diffi¬ 
cult  of  germination,  such  as  parsley,  car¬ 
rots  and  parsnips.  Radishes  may,  however, 
be  grown  in  closely  spaced  rows.  The 
seed  may  be  broadcast,  or  it  may  be  inter- 
planted  with  other  crops.  Depending  on 
the  variety,  rows  may  be  six,  eight  or  ten 
inches  apart  and  thinned  to  l]/2  to  3 
inches  apart  in  the  row.  Only  shallow 
covering  of  the  seed  is  necessary,  but  the 
seed  bed  should  be  firmed  with  the  feet 
or  with  the  butt  end  of  the  hoe  or  rake, 
especially  on  lighter  soils.  Winter  vari¬ 
eties  might  best  be  separated  by  three  to 
five  inches  in  the  rows,  or,  if  the  large 
Chinese  or  Japanese  sorts  are  planted  for 
winter  storage,  they  should  be  spaced  six 
to  ten  inches  apart. 


Culture.  Any  good  rich  garden  soil, 
supplied  with  plenty  of  moisture  and 
organic  matter  from  manure  or  compost 
material,  will  grow  excellent  radishes. 
Quick  maturity  usually  determines  quality. 
Such  early  varieties  as  Scarlet  Globe  will 
produce  crisp  and  sizable  roots  in  three  or 
four  weeks  after  sowing.  Crimson  Giant 
is  somewhat  larger  in  size,  but  Sparkler 
and  Scarlet  Turnip  are  excellent  home¬ 
grown  sorts.  If  you  prefer  your  radishes 
white,  then  the  White  Icicle  will  usually 
produce  straight  pure  white  roots.  A  suc¬ 
cession  of  almost  any  variety  may  be 
planted,  although  after  July  1st  such  sum¬ 
mer  varieties  as  White  Strassburg  and 
Chartier  or  Giant  Stuttgart  should  be 
planted.  Among  the  more  desirable  winter 
varieties,  are  Chinese  White,  Black  Span¬ 
ish,  and  Chinese  Rose. 

Rhubarb 

This  standard  hardy  perennial  of  the 
garden,  otherwise  known  as  "pie-plant," 
has  much  to  commend  it,  even  when 
limited  for  needed  space  for  perennial 
garden  crops.  As  few  as  four  or  five 
clumps  of  rhubarb  will  supply  a  small 
family  with  a  goodly  supply  of  wholesome 
fruit. 

Culture.  Although  rhubarb  is  readily 
grown  from  seed  sown  under  glass,  it  is 
best  to  purchase  good  strong  roots  with 
well-developed  eyes.  These  are  set  with 
their  crowns  three  or  four  inches  below 
the  surface  of  the  soil.  With  proper  cul¬ 
tivation,  hand  hoeing,  and  weeding,  rhu¬ 
barb  may  be  depended  upon  for  at  least 
six  or  eight  years.  If  judgment  is  used  in 
harvesting,  at  no  time  should  the  plants 
be  deprived  of  more  than  two-thirds  of 
their  leaves  and  stalks.  Cuttings  should 
cease  in  early  summer.  Although  deep 
rich  sandy  loams  bountifully  supplied  with 


GUARD  YOUR  HEALTH  FOR  YOUR  OWN  AND  YOUR  COUNTRY’S  SAKE  ir*,-

*  *  *  *  *  55 


organic  matter  are  more  nearly  ideal,  some 
of  our  heavier  soils  can  readily  be  condi¬ 
tioned  by  liberal  use  of  well-rotted  ma¬ 
nure  and  judicious  use  of  coal  ashes. 

Rutabaga  * 

The  rutabaga  or  Swedish  turnip  differs 
from  our  ordinary  turnip  or  "cow  turnip’’ 
in  several  important  particulars.  The 
larger  edible  roots  contain  less  moisture, 
finer-grained  flesh,  a  richer  flavor,  and 
in  cool  climates  are  more  productive.  The 
quality  of  the  rutabaga  is  adversely  af¬ 
fected  by  warm  weather. 

Culture .  In  the  North  rutabaga  seed 
should  not  be  sown  until  after  the  middle 
of  June,  and  probably  not  later  than  the 
middle  of  July  if  grown  for  winter  stor¬ 
age.  When  sown  in  rows,  the  plants 
should  be  thinned  to  six  or  eight  inches 
in  the  row,  and  rows  are  preferably  twenty 
to  twenty-four  inches  apart.  Long  Island 
Improved  and  Purpletop  Yellow  are  the 
popular  yellow-fleshed  sorts,  and  Macom- 
ber  is  the  usual  selection  for  those  who 
want  to  grow  white  rutabagas. 

Salsify 

Salsify  or  Vegetable  Oyster  may  be 
grown  north,  south,  east  or  west  unless 
you  or  your  family  are  prejudiced  against 
the  otherwise  delectable  flavor  of  this 
vegetable,  which  suggests  but  does  not  re¬ 
semble  the  flavor  of  the  oyster.  This  root 
crop  can  be  depended  upon  for  fall  use, 
and  for  winter  use  if  properly  stored. 

Culture.  Any  good  loose  garden  soil 
implemented  with  plant  food,  will  grow 
salsify,  the  growing  habits  of  which  are 
very  much  like  those  of  parsnips  or 


The  Dawn  Patrol 


carrots.  The  use  of  fresh  manure  should 
be  avoided,  and  if  well-rotted  animal 
manures  are  not  available,  reliance  should 
be  placed  on  commercial  fertilizer.  The 
seed  may  be  sown  in  the  open  ground 
very  early  in  the  spring,  and  the  rows  need 
not  be  more  than  one  foot  apart,  the  plants 
being  thinned  to  three  or  four  inches  in 
the  row.  Only  fresh  salsify  seed  should 
be  used  since  it  loses  its  vitality  often  after 
one  year.  Sandwich  Island  is  the  best 
known  variety. 

Shallot  * 

The  true  shallot  is  a  very  mild-flavored 
type  of  onion,  but  it  should  not  be  con¬ 
fused  with  the  Potato  or  Multiplier 
onions,  which  are  sometimes  sold  on  the 
market  as  shallots.  The  bulb,  which  is 
the  edible  portion,  somewhat  resembles 
that  of  garlic,  but  the  bulblets  or  cloves, 
instead  of  being  enveloped  in  a  mem¬ 
brane,  are  loosely  joined  at  the  base. 

Culture.  The  culture  of  the  shallot  is 
so  similar  to  that  of  onions  grown  from 
sets  as  to  require  no  specific  instructions 
other  than  to  suggest  the  use  of  a  good, 
rich,  well-drained  soil  and  a  supply  of 
ample  moisture  during  the  growing  sea¬ 
son.  Although  a  permanent  bed  of  shal¬ 
lots  may  be  established,  the  better  prac¬ 
tice  is  to  store  the  cloves  and  put  out  the 
sets  every  year.

Soy  Bean 

The  development  of  edible  varieties  of 
the  soy  bean  has  now  reached  a  stage 
which  will  justify  the  growing  of  the 
edible  soy  in  our  garden  because  of  its 
high  protein  and  vitamin  content,  and 
also  its  usefulness  as  a  "fill  in"  or  "in-be¬ 
tween"  season  crop.  In  many  gardens 
they  will  take  the  place  of  pole  or  runner 
beans,  and  varieties  may  be  chosen  to 
provide  a  succession  of  tender  green  soys. 

V, 

Culture.  Seeds  should  be  planted 
when  all  danger  of  frost  is  over,  in  rows 
two  feet  apart,  thinning  to  six  or  eight 
inches  in  the  row.  Although  soy  beans 
do  not  give  an  immediate  response  to 
fertilizer  as  do  snap  beans,  better  yields 
are  obtained  on  richer  soils  that  have  been 
manured  or  fertilized  the  previous  year. 
A  selection  from  a  dozen  or  more  newly 
developed  varieties  might  well  include 
Agate,  Easycook,  Funk  Delicious,  Bansei, 
Chusei,  Kanro,  or  Nanda. 

Spinach  *  * 

Believe  it  or  not,  spinach  is  the  most 
popular  pot  herb  or  green  in  the  United 
States.  The  dietitians’  favorable  propa¬ 
ganda  is  justified  by  the  intrinsic  merit 
of  spinach.  This  hardy  cool  weather 


plant  is  with  us  spring,  summer,  and  fall 
in  the  North;  and  it  is  an  ideal  crop  for 
many  sections  of  the  South  throughout 
the  winter.  Although  spinach  will  not 
withstand  the  extreme  heat  of  summer 
or  the  extreme  cold  of  winter,  it  deserves 
its  well-earned  place  in  home  gardens. 

Culture.  Almost  any  fertile  well- 
drained,  properly  limed  soil,  and  a  reason¬ 
able  moisture  supply,  along  with  moder¬ 
ately  cool  growing  weather,  will  produce 
an  abundance  of  spinach.  To  be  true, 
larger  yields  will  be  obtained  on  the 
richer  soils  that  are  well  supplied  with 
organic  matter.  The  preparation  of  soil 
for  growing  spinach  should  provide  for 
the  use  of  about  a  bushel  of  manure  and 
forty  pounds  of  a  high-grade  commercial 
fertilizer  per  one  thousand  square  feet. 
Since  spinach  rows  are  planted  close  to¬ 
gether,  a  broadcast  application  of  both 
manure  and  fertilizer  is  desirable.  How¬ 
ever,  use  one-half  of  this  quantity  if  ap¬ 
plied  only  in  the  row;  and  thoroughly 
cultivate  into  the  soil  before  final  prepa¬ 
ration  of  the  seed  bed. 

Spinach  seed  may  be  sown  one  or  two 
weeks  before  the  last  expected  spring 
frost,  in  rows  twelve  to  sixteen  inches 
apart,  and  thinned  to  two  or  three  inches 
in  the  row.  A  succession  of  plantings 
may  continue  until  the  approach  of  hot 
weather.  For  the  fall  crop,  seedings  may 
be  made  any  time  up  to  six  weeks  in 
advance  of  the  first  expected  fall  frost. 

Although  the  new  yellows-  and  blight- 
resistant  strains  are  just  as  desirable  for 
the  home  gardener  as  for  the  commercial 
producer,  many  of  us  prefer  to  plant  the 
variety  Nobel,  or  Giant  Thick  Leaf,  for 
the  early  crop,  since  it  is  productive  and 
does  not  bolt  or  prematurely  go  to  seed. 
Virginia  Savoy  is  the  leading  blight- 
resistant  variety.  Spinach  is  remarkably 
free  from  insect  ravages. 


Edible  soys  for  the  garden  are  no  longer  a  novelty

New  Zealand  Spinach  * 

Although  New  Zealand  Spinach  is  not 
even  "first  of  kin’’  to  our  common  spin¬ 
ach,  it  is  an  excellent  substitute  for  it. 
Furthermore,  it  may  be  relied  upon  to 
carry  on  during  the  hot  summer  when 
other  spinach  is  not  available.  A  single 
planting  of  either  seed  or  plants  early 
in  the  spring  is  all  that  is  necessary,  since 
the  tender  leaves  and  tips  are  regularly 
clipped  without  injury  to  the  plant  from 
June  until  October. 

Culture.  The  rather  large  seeds,  al¬ 
though  slow  to  germinate,  are  readily 
started  indoors  under  the  same  conditions 
specified  for  tomato  and  pepper  plants, 
excepting  that  it  is  not  necessary  to  trans¬ 
plant  or  pot  before  setting  out  in  the 
garden.  A  spacing  of  about  three  feet 
apart  for  the  rows  and  eighteen  to  twenty 
inches  apart  in  the  row  will  provide  room 
for  the  development  of  the  plant  with  its 
spreading  branches.  If  grown  from  seeds, 
cover  them  with  about  one  and  a  half 
inches  of  soil  but  do  not  plant  sooner 
than  ten  days  before  danger  of  frost  is 
past.  Quality  as  well  as  quantity  of  this 
excellent  pot  herb  will  follow  liberal 
fertilization  in  the  presence  of  ample  sun¬ 
light  and  moisture. 


Squash 

The  true  squashes  differ  from  pumpkins 
by  their  soft,  spongy  stems,  which  are  not 
ridged  or  furrowed  like  the  hard,  woody 
stem  of  the  pumpkin.  Thus  the  vegetable 
marrow  and  bush  scallop  and  so-called 
summer  crookneck  squash  are  in  reality 
pumpkins.  To  make  this  distinction  clear, 
these  will  be  separately  treated  under 
"Vegetable  Marrows  and  Scallops." 


Culture .  The  culture  of  squashes  and 
pumpkins  is  similar  to  that  for  cucumbers. 
While  a  place  for  a  hill  here  or  there 
might  be  found  in  larger  home  gardens, 
it  is  rare  that  a  space  may  be  found  large 
enough  to  grow  the  trailing  varieties, 
which  should  be  planted  ten  to  twelve 
feet  apart  in  each  direction.  The  smaller 
bush  varieties  may  be  set  as  close  as  five 
or  six  feet  apart  each  way.  In  any  case, 
a  good,  deep  hill  should  be  made  up  with 
well-rotted  manure,  a  small  handful 
.of  fertilizer,  and  ten  or  twelve  seeds  cov¬ 
ered  in  it  to  a  depth  of  not  more  than  1  y2 
inches.  Cultivation  underneath  the  grow¬ 
ing  vines  and  hand  weeding  are  impor¬ 
tant  until  a  matted  growth  is  formed. 
Usually  only  the  best  of  two  or  three 
specimens  on  a  vine  are  allowed  to  mature 
in  the  case  of  the  larger  varieties. 

The  Boston  marrow  is  a  pear-shaped, 
true  squash  and  should  not  be  confused 
with  the  vegetable  marrow.  Such  late 
maturing  varieties  as  Golden  Delicious, 
Kitchenette,  Table  Queen,  Des  Moines, 
and  the  various  types  of  Hubbard  will 
provide  the  variations  so  often  seen  in 
shapes,  colors,  wartiness,  and  smoothness. 
Nearly  all  late  winter  squashes,  excepting 
Mammoth  and  Mammoth  Whale,  ,  have 
good  table  qualities. 

Sweet  Potato 

V 

Sweet  potatoes  are  at  their  best  in  light, 
sandy  soils,  and  when  planted  in  heavy 
soils  are  usually  of  poorer  quality.  Like 
white  potatoes,  they  are  not  a  standard 
home  garden  crop;  but  if  sweet-potato 
sprouts  (or  slips)  are  available  in  your 
market,  and  you  have  some  light,  loamy 
sand  that  will  not  produce  other  vege¬ 
tables  during  the  heat  of  summer,  you 
may  be  able  to  grow  good  "sweets"  for 
winter  consumption.  The  sweet-potato 
sprouts  are  set  twelve  to  sixteen  inches

apart  in  ridges  thirty  inches  apart  instead 
of  in  furrows.  They  should  preferably 
be  set  in  the  late  afternoon,  with  a  pint 
of  water  used  to  each  plant.  As  cultiva¬ 
tion  is  carried  on  throughout  the  season, 
the  ridges  are  gradually  broken  down,  the 
vines  being  lifted  or  turned  two  or  three 
times  to  effect  weed  eradication  and  to 
prevent  their  taking  root  in  the  soil. 

Fertilizer,  Sweet  potatoes  demand 
plenty  of  potash,  and  get  along  on  rela¬ 
tively  little  nitrogen.  For  this  reason, 
sweet-potato  fertilizers  usually  run  about 
two  to  three  per  cent  of  nitrogen,  eight 
per  cent  of  available  phosphoric  acid,  and 
ten  to  eighteen  per  cent  of  potash.  The 
use  of  too  much  lime  may  induce  the  de¬ 
velopment  of  scurf,  but  since  "sweets” 
are  not  so  sensitive  to  scurf  as  the  white 
potato  is  to  scab,  they  may  be  grown  in 
rotation  with  other  crops  on  soils  that 
have  been  moderately  limed. 

Your  choice  of  distinct  sweet-potato 
varieties  will  no  doubt  be  limited,  but  if 
you  like  the  dry,  mealy  types,  Nansemond, 
Big-Stem  Jersey,  and  Gold  Skin  will 
answer  your  purpose.  The  moist  flesh 
types  common  to  the  South  are  more 
often  yams,  such  as  Dooley,  Southern 
Queen,  Nancy  Hall,  and  Porto  Rico. 
Sweet  potatoes  are  dug  after  the  first  light 
frost  and  will  "keep  well”  only  if  storage 
temperatures  are  high — 75  degrees  to  90 
degrees  for  two  or  three  weeks,  and  50 
to  60  degrees  thereafter. 

Tomato  *  * 

The  tomato  is  so  well  adapted  for  use 
in  all  sizes  and  kinds  of  home  gardens 
that  we  may  truly  say  it  is  the  most  popu¬ 
lar  home  garden  vegetable.  Tomatoes  are 
almost  entirely  grown  from  plants  started 
from  seed  indoors  in  the  North,  or  in 
specially  prepared  beds  in  the  South. 


Cool,  damp  seasons  may  cause  pale  complexions 

Although  they  may  fruit  in  almost  any 
soil,  the  full  development  of  tomato 
plants  with  an  abundance  of  fruit  can 
only  be  attained  on  the  most  fertile  and 
best-drained  garden  soils.  Warm  weather 
and  plenty  of  sunshine  and  absence  of 
strong  winds  at  blossoming  time  will 
favor  the  early  crop,  although  moderately 
heavy  clay  loams  produce  large  yields 
of  good  quality  late  tomatoes.  Clean  and 
shallow  tillage  to  keep  down  weeds  and 
trimming  of  the  lower  branches  of  toma¬ 
toes  if  staked  are  accepted  practice. 

Culture,  Seeds  should  be  sown  six  to 
eight  weeks  before  the  plants  are  needed. 
The  small  home  gardener  may  even  start 
them  in  a  window  box,  transplanting  them 
into  paper  drinking  cups  after  the  second 
pair  of  true  leaves  appear.  Then  when 
three  or  four  inches  high,  the  plants 
should  be  hardened  in  open  windows  dur¬ 
ing  the  warmer  portions  of  the  day.  Plants 
that  are  so  hardened  should  of  course  not 
be  kept  in  warm  rooms  at  night.  Tomato 
plants  may  be  set  in  the  garden  when 
danger  of  frost  is  definitely  over.  Rais¬ 
ing  one’s  own  tomato  plants  may  be  justi¬ 
fied  only  by  the  owners  of  larger  gardens, 
since  a  goodly  supply  in  many  desirable 
varieties  is  available  in  cities  and  country

towns  alike.  The  variety  and  habit  of 
growth  of  the  tomato  will  determine  the 
space  required  in  the  garden.  On  the 
average,  plants  set  three  feet  apart  each 
way  will  have  ample  room  for  develop¬ 
ment,  especially  when  staked.  It  is  always 
well,  after  punching  a  hole  for  setting 
tomato  plants,  to  set  them  down  an  inch 
deeper  than  they  grew  as  seedlings,  soak 
with  water,  and  pack  the  moist  soil  well 
after  setting,— then  protect  them  with  a 
well-ventilated  sunshade  for  a  day  or  two. 


It  pays  to  set  stocky  tomato  plants 


Fertilizer.  Only  well-rotted  manure 
should  be  applied  before  the  tomato 

plants  are  set.  The  soil  should  be  thor¬ 
oughly  prepared  and  properly  fertilized. 
At  least  ten  pounds  per  one  hundred  feet 
of  row  of  a  4-8-8  or  a  4-8-10  fertilizer 
should  be  broadcast  and  thoroughly 

worked  into  the  soil,  or  half  this  quantity 
applied  in  the  rows.  On  the  heavier  clay 
loams,  a  4-10-6  fertilizer  is  satisfactory. 
If  fertilizer  is  not  applied  broadcast  or  in 
the  row,  a  small  fistful  may  be  thrown 
around  the  plants.  This  should  be 

worked  into  the  soil,  but  contact  with 

young  roots  should  be  avoided. 

Varieties .  From  the  scores  of  varie¬ 
ties  of  tomatoes  offered  the  public,  the 


home  gardener’s  choice  should  be  nar¬ 
rowed  down  to  one  good  extra-early,  a 
second  early,  and  a  late  tomato,  thus  pro¬ 
viding  a  continuous  supply  in  most  sec¬ 
tions  from  the  4th  of  July  until  after 
frost.  The  best  varieties  for  you  to  grow 
are  those  that  have  been  tested  and  ac¬ 
cepted  in  your  locality.  Of  the  varieties 
which  have  almost  nation-wide  accept¬ 
ance,  and  in  order  of  their  normal  fruit¬ 
ing  from  early  to  late,  are  select  strains 
of  Earliana,  Break-O’-Day,  Bonny  Best, 
Marglobe,  Globe,  Greater  Baltimore,  and 
Stone.  There  are  also  new  and  excellent 
disease-resistant  strains  of  both  Early  and 
Greater  Baltimore,  Marglobe,  Scarlet 
Topper,  Rutgers,  and  Illinois  Pride, 
which  are  heavy-yielding  wilt-and-rust- 
resistant  sorts  adapted  for  the  main-  or 
late-season  crop.  The  Ponderosa  is  still 
a  home  garden  favorite  for  large  speci¬ 
men,  solid-fleshed  fruit.  Other  large  thick- 
fleshed,  small-seeded  specialties,  such  as 
the  Beefheart,  are  undoubtedly  improve¬ 
ments  over  the  original  Ponderosa  or 
Beefsteak  types.  There  are  white-skinned 
and  yellow-skinned  novelties,  but  the 
small  red  or  yellow  ”plum-or-pear”-type 
tomatoes  are  well  worth  the  planting — 
just  to  have  a  bushel  or  more  for  tomato 
preserves. 

Diseases.  Heme  gardeners  usually 
escape  the  troubles  of  market  gardeners, 
who  often  suffer  losses  from  leaf  spot, 
blossom-end  rot,  and  wilt;  but  vigilance 
in  persistently  "hand  picking”  the  large, 
green,  tomato  fruitworms  and  Horn- 
worms  or  else  killing  them  with  a  stand¬ 
ard  stomach-poison  spray  of  calcium 
arsenate  or  Paris  green  will  often  prevent 
a  total  loss  of  vines  and  fruit.  Plants 
sprayed  with  bordeaux  mixture  are  pro¬ 
vided  with  a  resistance  to  wilt  and  are 
less  subject  to  attack  by  flea  beetles.

A  wealth  of  vegetables  in  a  community  garden 

Turnip  * 

Turnips  may  be  grown  in  the  North 
both  in  spring  and  fall.  Being  a  cool 
weather  crop,  they  should  be  sown  in  the 
South  during  the  fall  and  early  winter. 
In  the  northern  home  garden,  turnips 
will  fill  in  a  gap  and  form  an  excellent 
succession  crop  to  early  peas,  spinach,  or 
potatoes. 

Culture .  Both  white-fleshed  and  yel¬ 
low-fleshed  varieties  of  turnips  with  or 
without  purple  tops  may  be  selected  from 
the  seed  catalog.  As  turnip  is  a  succession 
crop,  seeds  may  be  sown  broadcast,  but 
most  gardeners  prefer  to  grow  them  in 
sixteen-  or  eighteen-inch  rows,  thinning 
the  plants  to  an  average  of  three  inches 
apart  for  the  young  tender  turnips,  or  up 
to  five  or  six  inches  if  the  turnips  are  to 
reach  maturity  for  winter  storage.  A  good 
fertile  soil,  a  fine  seed  bed,  plenty  of 
plant  food  and  ample  moisture  favor  good 
quality  and  large  yields  of  turnip. 

Varieties .  Purple  Top  White  Globe 
is  probably  the  most  popular  white- 
fleshed  sort,  and  either  Orange  Jelly  or 
Golden  Ball  is  a  good  yellow-fleshed 
variety.  Rutabaga,  which  is  a  different 
species  of  turnip,  is  given  separate 
treatment.  Home-grown  turnips  are 
usually  free  of  diseases.

Vegetable  Marrows  and 
Scallops  * 

The  small  varieties  of  pumpkins 
known  as  vegetable  marrows  and  bush 
scallops,  including  the  so-called  summer 
crookneck  squashes,  are  of  distinctive 
character  from  the  standpoint  of  house¬ 
hold  use.  In  order  to  distinguish  them 
from  true  squashes,  they  are  here  given 
separate  consideration.  The  early  White 
Bush  scallop,  or  White  Pattypan,  is  usu¬ 
ally  preferred  to  the  yellow-skinned 
strains.  Of  the  scallops,  the  Long  White 
Marrow  is  one  of  the  best,  but  the  English 
Marrow,  although  of  a  good  strain,  is  of 
the  vining  type.  Increasingly  popular,  the 
Italian  Marrow,  otherwise  known  as  Coco- 
zelle  or  Zucchini,  is  very  prolific  and  well 
adapted  to  home  gardens.  There  are  sev¬ 
eral  variations  of  the  summer  crooknecks 
and  Early  Prolific  Straightnecks.  One  of 
the  best  is  Yellow  Summer  Crookneck. 

The  bush  and  small-vine  varieties  may 
be  planted  in  hills  as  close  as  four  feet 
apart,  or  the  seed  may  be  dropped  in  rows 
and  thinned  to  the  desired  distance.  Cul¬ 
tivation  should  be  shallow  to  avoid  injury 
to  the  roots  and  limited  to  destruction  of 
weeds.
